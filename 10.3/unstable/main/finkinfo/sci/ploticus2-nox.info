    A simple C-callable API that allows Ploticus to be embedded in other
    applications, and facilitates interfaces to Perl, PHP, Python, etc.
    This build does not support X11.

    Note that there is no header file for this library.

    Changes to Makefile_api:

    (Un)commented the Mac OS X section.

    Copied the XLIBS and ADDLIBS make variables from the main Makefile
    in order to build a dynamic shared library. Added an appropriate cc
    command to actually build the library.

    Added -lming to the libraries list (it appeared to be missing).

    Patched all locations that are somewhere in the fink tree, as noted
    for the main package.

    Uncommented the NOXFLAG section to disable X11 support, added XLIBS
    = and XINCLUDEDIR =.

    Set FLAGS = -fno-common, GDLEVEL = -DGD18, GDOBJ =, GDHEADERS =
    -I@PREFIX@/include, GDFREETYPE = -DGDFREETYPE (even though it
    doesn't appear to get used anywhere).

    Enabled all output options and locale support.
  <<
  DescPackaging: <<
    The main package isn't required, but it is recommended because it
    includes the prefabs directory and more importantly, the full
    ploticus documentation :) The API documentation and a usage example
    are included in the ploticus2-dev splitoff.

    Note that there is no header file for this API.

## Additional data
##
DescDetail: <<
  Ploticus is a free, GPL, non-interactive software package for
  producing plots, charts, and graphics from data. It was developed in a
  Unix/C environment and runs on various Unix, Linux, and win32 systems.
  ploticus is good for automated or just-in-time graph generation,
  handles date and time data nicely, and has basic statistical
  capabilities. It allows significant user control over colors, styles,
  options and details. It is available as a command-line tool, and can
  also be invoked via CGI. C developers can use libploticus. Other
  interfaces exist for packages such as Python.

  Ploticus can produce PNG and JPEG images; and PostScript, EPS, SVG and
  SWF (shockwave-flash) vector formats. Server-side or client-side
  imagemaps can be generated for providing click-thru or mouseover popup
  text bubbles in web-based applications.

  This build does not support X11.

  Note that for SWF (Flash) support to work, you will need to install
  some FDB fonts. You can download a few such fonts from the Ploticus
  web site (see below).

  Full HTML documentation and examples are included with the package.

DescPort: <<
  Changes to Makefile:

  (Un)commented the appropriate section (the section for Linux/FreeBSD).
  We're compiling with all features switched on (except X11 support, see
  below), so set the ploticus target to plgd18.

  Patched all locations that are somewhere in the fink tree. This
  defaults to %p and is passed in from the compile script. (Thanks to
  Jeff Whitaker for pointing this out.)

  Added -L@PREFIX@/lib to ADDLIBS (also see libfreetype comment below)
  and -I@PREFIX@/include to GD18H.

  Enabled Ming/SWF support.

  Set FLAGS = -dynamic to force use of dynamic shared libraries rather
  than static ones.

  Set PL = ploticus (defines the name of the binary) to avoid a conflict
  with pre-existing /usr/bin/pl.

  The ploticus prefabs directory is hardcoded as %p/share/%n/prefabs
  (passed in from the compile script via the PREFABS_DIR make variable).

  Uncommented the NOXFLAG section to disable X11 support, added
  XINCLUDEDIR =.

  This build of Ploticus doesn't link with X11, so we technically don't
  have the same problem with dual copies of libfreetype that the
  ploticus2 package does (see the ploticus2 package description for more
  details). However, it is still possible that someone might choose to
  install ploticus2-nox even though they have X11 installed. We
  therefore still need -dylib_file
  /usr/X11R6/lib/libfreetype.6.dylib:@PREFIX@/lib/libfreetype.6.dylib in
  the GD18LIBS makefile variable to force ld to link to
  /sw/lib/libfreetype. This still appears to work OK even when
  /usr/X11R6/lib/libfreetype.6.dylib doesn't exist (phew!).

  Enabled locale support.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
  Patches the makefiles to compile properly under Darwin. Also applies
  any late patches from the Ploticus author before compiling.

  Note that there are no header files for the ploticus API shared
  libary. That's why the package doesn't install any :) and why it
  doesn't need a BuildDependsOnly line. Also, the main package is
  totally independent of the -shlibs package, which is why it doesn't
  depend on it as you might normally expect.

  Although the full documentation is a separate download, it is included
  in this package because Ploticus is somewhat non-intuitive. The full
  documentation comes with a comprehensive gallery of fully-documented
  examples.

  I've patched the documentation to change most references to "pl" (the
  original binary name) to "ploticus". I've also removed most references
  to GIF since this build doesn't support pseudo-GIF creation (not for
  any political reasons --- the Makefile simply doesn't include it when
  you enable all the other formats). Similarly, since this build doesn't
  support X11, I've done the same for most X11 references. Obviously, it
  would be improper to change any references that are are historical in
  nature, refer to a package for another operating system or are in a
  feedback email, so I've left these as they are. I also fixed the odd
  typo that I noticed :) The upshot of all this is that the Fink package
  documentation differs somewhat from the official documentation
  provided at the ploticus web site. It also makes for a big patch
  (>200KB), but I think it's justified, and isn't unheard of.

  Although Steve Grubb supplies a few FDB fonts (for Flash/SWF) on the
  Ploticus web site, I haven't included them (either here or as a
  separate package) because I don't know about the licensing of these
  fonts.

  Note that author of Ploticus now considers this to be the official Mac
  OS X port. Whee!
