Description: Powerful network protocol analyzer (with SSL)
DescDetail: <<
Wireshark is a free network protocol analyzer for Unix and Windows.
It allows you to examine data from a live network or from a capture
file on disk. You can interactively browse the capture data, viewing
summary and detail information for each packet. Wireshark has several
powerful features, including a rich display filter language and the
ability to view the reconstructed stream of a TCP session.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
Although this package is license under the GPL, the -SSL variant is
marked Restrictive since it links to OpenSSL.

PATCH: A patch is used to force gnutls and libgcrypt checks to always
fail for the non-SSL variant of this package.

PATCH: Building idl2wrs is broken in the base package, we fix this.

PATCH: Modify PLUGIN_LIBS to ensure that we link against the freshly
built (but not yet installed) version of libwireshark, instead of
linking to a previously installed version of it.

Might eventually link against and depend on the adns and lua packages.
Since adns and lua are not in stable, I am not (yet) doing this.
