Description: Flexible library for input handling
DescDetail: <<
Input library developed by the GGI Project. Its design philosophy is
similar to LibGGI, which deals with graphics output.

LibGII is based on the concept of input streams, which virtualize access
to the underlying input drivers. Events from various input devices are
abstracted into easy-to-use structures. LibGII also allows the
application to join streams together, receiving input from an arbitrary
combination of devices.

LibGII is a separate component from LibGGI, although LibGGI depends on
LibGII for input purposes. (LibGGI's input functions are simply wrappers
for LibGII functions.) Ê
