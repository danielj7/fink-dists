  Description: Remote mail folder access server
  DescDetail: <<
    IMAP (the Interactive Mail Access Protocol) is a mechanism for
    accessing mail folders and the messages in them remotely, ie with
    your user mail program running on a different machine to the one
    where all the messages are stored.

    If you do install uw-imapd you will almost certainly want to install a
    Mail Transfer Agent such as Smail or Sendmail, as remote mail
    programs which use IMAP to access incoming and saved mail will
    usually want to send mail using SMTP, often to the same machine.

    This server has SSL support built in.
