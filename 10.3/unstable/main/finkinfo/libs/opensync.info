Description: Synchronization framework
DescDetail: <<
OpenSync is a synchronization framework that is platform and
distribution independent.  It consists of a powerful sync-engine and
several plugins that can be used to connect to devices.

OpenSync is very flexible and capable of synchronizing any type of
data, including contacts, calendar, tasks, notes and files.

The goals of OpenSync:

* Provide a framework that can be used for general synchronization
* Reusability.  The framework should be usable by many applications
* Speed.  Synchronization should be as fast as possible.
* Flexibility.  We cannot predict what formats / devices the future
  will bring.  Therefore OpenSync is built as flexible and modular
  as possible.
* Integrity.  Data must never be lost, no matter what happens.
* Portability.  The framework should run on as many platforms as
  possible (Linux, Windows, Mac OS, BSD, etc)
* Language neutral.  OpenSync is extensible in using other languages
  like python, java and even more.
* No dependencies on a X-server.  OpenSync is a library that can be
  embed into other applications.  Therefore it is possible to use
  GUIs, CLIs or whatever you can imagine.
