Description: Dynamic window manager for X
DescDetail: <<
dwm is a minimalistic window manager. It manages windows in tiling and floating
modes, much like ion, larswm and wmii. dwm however is much smaller, faster and
simpler. It consists of only a single binary and configuration is done at
compile-time. dwm reads from standard input to print arbitrary status text such
as the date and/or system load.
