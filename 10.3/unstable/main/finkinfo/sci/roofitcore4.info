Package: roofitcore4
Description: Toolkit for modeling physics event distributions
DescDetail: <<
The core package provides tools to perform likelihood fits, produce
plots, and generate "toy Monte Carlo" samples for various physics studies. The
RooFit tools are integrated with the object-oriented and interactive
ROOT graphical environment.  

RooFit has been developed for the BaBar collaboration, a high energy
physics experiment at the  Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, and is
primarily targeted to the high-energy physicists using the ROOT
analysis environment, but the general nature of the package make it
suitable for adoption in different disciplines as well.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
This package depends on root4, but is overwise identical to roofitcore
which depends on root3.
