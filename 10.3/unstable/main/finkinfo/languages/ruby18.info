DescDetail: <<
- It has many features to process text files and to do system
  management tasks (as in Perl).
- It is simple, straight-forward, extensible, and portable, and free.
- It has simple syntax, partially inspired by Eiffel and Ada.
- All data in Ruby is an object, not in the sense of Python or Perl,
  but in the sense of Smalltalk: no exceptions.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
The Ruby tcltk and ssl extensions are packaged separately.  The ssl
extension since Fink has a crypto branch for ssl programs, and the
tcltk extension for linking against Fink's X11 version of tcltk, in
case Ruby needs to be linked against an Aqua version.

Packages should depend on ruby18 to run scripts. The shared library
does not provide many of the stdlib features, they are implemented in
the bundled extensions.

The extensions would link and probably run with Apple's libraries but
since Fink has its own version of ncurses, readline, etc. it should
always link with Fink's to get consistent results.

Move mkmf script into -dev to make extension configuration error out
instead of failing all tests.

To properly configure a ruby extension the interpreter of the right
version has to be executable as ruby, and the corresponding library
available as libruby (at least this is the easiest way).  It is
possible to execute the extconf.rb script with an interpreter of
choice (i.e. ruby1.8) but extensions that use more complex
configuration scripts (i.e. autoconf) will usually try to execute just
ruby.

The config.guess script is modified so that extensions are installed
in %p/lib/ruby/r_maj.r_min/cpu-darwin (in contrast to
%p/lib/ruby/r_maj.r_min/cpu-darwin_os_maj.os_min which makes binary
extension packages useless when the interpreter package is recompiled
after a system upgrade).

The Debian ruby1.8_1.8.3-2 package was used as a source for this
package.  Many of the same configure command line options are used.
Also, of the patches except for the 902_extra_search_path.patch from
that package are included in this package.  The three patches 00* are
not from the Debian package.
