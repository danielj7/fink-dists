Description: Load balancer for simple tcp based protocol
DescDetail: <<
Pen is a load balancer for "simple" tcp based protocols such as http or smtp.
It allows several servers to appear as one to the outside and automatically
detects servers that are down and distributes clients among the available
servers. This gives high availability and scalable performance.
