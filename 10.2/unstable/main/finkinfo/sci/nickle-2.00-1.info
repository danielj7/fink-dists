Description: Desk Calculator scripting language
DescDetail: <<
From the man page:
  Nickle  is  a  desk calculator language with powerful pro-
  gramming and scripting capabilities.   Nickle  supports  a
  variety of datatypes, especially arbitrary precision inte-
  gers, rationals, and imprecise reals.  The input  language
  vaguely resembles C.  Some things in C which do not trans-
  late easily are different, some design choices  have  been
  made differently, and a very few features are simply miss-
  ing.
