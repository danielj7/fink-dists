DescDetail: <<
 Pdsh is a high-performance, parallel remote shell utility. It has 
 built-in, thread-safe clients for Berkeley and Kerberos V4 rsh, 
 and can call SSH externally (though with reduced performance). 
 Pdsh uses a "sliding window" parallel algorithm to conserve socket
 resources on the initiating node and to allow progress to continue
 while timeouts occur on some connections.
<<
DescUsage: <<
 The Fink pdsh package is built with the following flags:
 
 --with-dshgroups
 --with-exec
 --with-nodeupdown
 --with-readline
 --with-ssh 
 --without-rsh 
 --without-xcpu 
 
 Note: this means that the rsh transport module is *NOT*
 available by default!  Avoid using rsh if possible.  
 Also, Xcpu support is not available.
