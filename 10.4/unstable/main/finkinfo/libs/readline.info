Description: Comfortable terminal input library
DescDetail: <<
 The GNU Readline library provides a set of functions for use by
 applications that allow users to edit command lines as they are typed
 in. Both Emacs and vi editing modes are available. The Readline
 library includes additional functions to maintain a list of
 previously-entered command lines, to recall and perhaps reedit those
 lines, and perform csh-like history expansion on previous commands.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
 Previous versions by Sylvain Cuaz.

 1) previous revisions by Christoph Pfisterer <chrisp@users.sourceforge.net>
 2) specify mandir & infodir
 3) the symbolic links from libreadline.4.2.dylib and libhistory.4.2.dylib are 
    needed for backward compatibility.  Future versions will also need links
    from libreadline.4.3.dylib and libhistory.4.3.dylib (due to the way
    things were done in readline-4.3-1 and readline-4.3-2).
<<
DescPort: <<

 1) don't bother trying to install-info (build runtime foc index),
    since we're not at the runtime location and fink deletes the results
    when creating the .deb
 2) set the compatibility-version to 4.2.0 to agree with previous versions of 
    the readline package
 3) (dmrrsn) SHLIB_XLDFLAGS and SHLIB_LIBS fields now match what is used in
    readline5 (only works for 10.3 and later)
