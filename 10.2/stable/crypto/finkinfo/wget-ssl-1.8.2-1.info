Description: Automatic web site retreiver, with SSL support
DescDetail: <<
 GNU Wget is a free network utility to retrieve files from the World
 Wide Web using HTTP and FTP, the two most widely used Internet
 protocols.  It works non-interactively, thus enabling work in the
 background, after having logged off.

 The recursive retrieval of HTML pages, as well as FTP sites is
 supported -- you can use Wget to make mirrors of archives and home
 pages, or traverse the web like a WWW robot.

 This package compiles wget with SSL (https) support.

 Uses libtool, but only for convenience libraries,
 so there is no need to update it.
