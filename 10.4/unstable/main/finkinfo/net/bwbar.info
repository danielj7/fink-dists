Description: Generates text and graphical readout of current bandwidth use
DescDetail: <<
 This program will output a PNG and a text file that can be used in scripts or
 be included in web pages to show current bandwidth usage. The amount of total
 bandwidth can be customized. The PNG output appears as a bar graph
 showing maximum possible usage with the current inbound or outbound usage
 shown as a differently colored bar.
