Description: Social Networks Visualizer, uses Qt4-Mac
DescDetail: <<
 SocNetV is a cross-platform, user-friendly, graphical application for Social
 Networks Analysis and Visualisation, developed in Qt4.
 It helps you construct social networks (aka mathematical graphs) with a
 few clicks on a virtual canvas or load networks of various formats
 (GraphViz, GraphML, Adjacency, Pajek, UCINET, etc) and modify them, or
 compute basic network properties, such as density, diameter and
 distances (shortest path lengths), as well as more advanced structural
 statistics, such as node and network centralities (i.e. closeness,
 betweeness, graph), clustering coefficient, etc.
 
 SocNetV supports various layout algorithms (i.e. Spring-embedder, circular
 and in levels according to various centrality indexes) for meaningful
 visualisations. Furthermore, it can create random networks (Erdos-Renyi,
 Watts-Strogatz, ring lattice, etc) with a few clicks.
