Description: Layout program (development branch 1.3.x)
DescDetail: << 
Scribus is a Layout program in the tradition of Corel Ventura[tm], Adobe
PageMaker[tm], QuarkXPress[tm] or Adobe InDesign[tm], except that it is
published under the GNU GPL.

Since its humble beginning in the spring of 2001, Scribus has
rapidly developed into one of the premier desktop applications for
Linux. Scribus 1.2 brings new power and versatile tools for desktop
publishing. New features like separation previews, cross-platform
Python scripting, advanced PDF 1.4 support are just some of the
improvements in Scribus 1.2.

Underneath the modern and user friendly interface, Scribus supports
professional publishing features, such as CMYK color and a simple color
management system to soft proof images destined for high quality color
printing. Other features include PDF Import, EPS import/export,
Unicode text including right to left scripts such as Arabic and Hebrew.
Scribus also has unexpected touches such as: useful vector drawing tools,
SVG import/export and support for OpenType Fonts.
The Scribus file format is XML based; open and completely documented.
<<
DescUsage: <<
 This version contains extensive online help. 
 Additional up-to-date documentation is on the Scribus web site.

 Fonts: By default, the X11 Type1 fonts are recognized. If you
 want more fonts, you can do one or more of the following:
 - Install the x-ghostscript-fonts or msttcorefonts or xfonts-intl 
   or applesystemfont packages. 
   (The gimp-sharefonts and similar packages work, too, 
   but these fonts are of rather bad quality)
 - Put lines like
     /Library/Fonts
     /System/Library/Fonts
   into your ~/.scribus/scribusfont13.rc file (create it if it doesn't exist)
   This will give you many (not all) of the Apple system fonts.
   If you use FontBook to create your own collections, put also
     ~/Library/Fonts
   into this file.
  Not all font types are working: OpenType and Resource Fork TrueType
  don't work, but the latter can be converted using fondu.

  Note that scribus-1.3.x and scribus-1.2.x use incompatible file
  formats. So be careful when switching between these versions.
<<
DescPort: <<
 scribus-scripting is contained in this version. It works now with
 Panther's Python.framework
<<
DescPackaging: <<
 The default profiles folder is now populated with a minimal set
 of color profiles from /System/Library/ColorSync/Profiles/
 so that color management can be activated.
