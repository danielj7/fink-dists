Description: 3D finite element mesh generator--shared lib
DescDetail: <<
 Gmsh is an automatic 3D finite element mesh generator (primarily
 Delaunay) with build-in CAD and post-processing facilities. Its
 design goal is to provide a simple meshing tool for academic test
 cases with parametric input and up to date visualization
 capabilities.

 Gmsh is built around four modules: geometry, mesh, solver and
 post-processing. The specification of any input to these modules is
 done either interactively using the graphical user interface or in
 ASCII text files using Gmsh's own scripting language.
 
 See Gmsh's reference manual for a more thorough overview of Gmsh's 
 capabilities.
<<
DescUsage: <<
This package provides a legacy shared library.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
	Patch contrib/mmg3d/build/sources/ratio.c where a non-void function has a 
	return without a value.
	
	There appears to be something awry in contrib/gmm/gmm_interface.h .
	clang from Xcode 4.3 decided that there was an error, and by inspection there
	appears indeed to be one.  I implemented a patch which seemed to be correct in
	context.

	Uses vecLib for BLAS.  (we patch this to Accelerate)
	It appears not to use Fink's ATLAS even when that's 
	installed, so no -atlas variant currently.

	No METIS or TETGEN support because of their license limitations.

	Unset MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET because newer cmake doesn't like it
	when it and OSX_SYSROOT mismatch (as when only the command line tools
	are installed).
