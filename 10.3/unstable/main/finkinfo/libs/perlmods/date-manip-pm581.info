Description: Perl Module to add Date::Manip 
DescDetail: <<
  This is a set of routines designed to make any common date/time
  manipulation easy to do.  Operations such as comparing two times,
  calculating a time a given amount of time from another, or parsing
  international times are all easily done.  From the very beginning, the main
  focus of Date::Manip has been to be able to do ANY desired date/time
  operation easily, not necessarily quickly.  Also, it is definitely oriented
  towards the type of operations we (as people) tend to think of rather than
  those operations used routinely by computers.  There are other modules that
  can do a subset of the operations available in Date::Manip much quicker
  than those presented here, so be sure to read the section SHOULD I USE
  DATE::MANIP below before deciding which of the Date and Time modules from
  CPAN is for you.
