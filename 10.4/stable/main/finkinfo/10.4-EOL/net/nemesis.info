Description: Packet Injection
DescDetail: <<
 Nemesis is a command-line network packet injection utility for
 UNIX-like and Windows systems. You might think of it as an EZ-bake
 packet oven or a manually controlled IP stack.
 With Nemesis, it is possible to generate and transmit
 packets from the command line or from within a shell script.

DescPackaging: <<
  As of nemesis-1.4-22, will *only* build with libnet1.0 (1.0.2a) not libnet1.1
