Description: Netcat 6 is a netcat clone with IPv6 support
DescDetail: <<
Netcat is a simple Unix utility which reads and writes data across network connections, using TCP or UDP protocol. It is designed to be a reliable backend tool that can be used directly or easily driven by other programs time, it is a feature-rich network debugging and exploration tool, since it can create almost any kind of connection you would need and has several interesting built-in capabilities. Netcat 6 enables IPv6 support as well as extended sockets in BSD.

DescPort: <<
Ipv6 Implementation has to be tested on Mac OS X. This is crucial since the IPv6 stack is only guessed by netcat6 and not determined yet. Please send me success or failure reports
