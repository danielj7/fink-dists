Description: Zuker's RNA secondary structure prediction
DescDetail: <<
mfold is a localized version of the mfold web server RNA folding prediction 
program by M. Zuker for the prediction of the secondary structure of single
stranded nucleic acids. The objective is to provide easy access to RNA and 
DNA folding and hybridization software to the scientific community 
at large. Detailed output, in the form of structure plots with or without 
reliability information, single strand frequency plots and energy dot plots, 
are available for the folding of single sequences. The portal for the mfold 
web server is http://www.bioinfo.rpi.edu/applications/mfold.
