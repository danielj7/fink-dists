DescDetail: << 
These files work "out of the box" but the template files
can be modified as follows. (The /sw/etc/zsh/zshenv and
/sw/etc/zsh/zshrc should not have to be modified.  If you
have to modify these, please report this as a bug.)
.
1. Issue sudo mkdir -p /Library/init/zsh/local-functions
.
2. Copy any file you want to modify from 
/sw/share/zsh/templates/Library/init/zsh into 
/Library/init/zsh and then edit it there.  That 
file will now be read INSTEAD OF the corresponding 
file in /sw/share/zsh/templates/Library/init/zsh.  
Anything that appears in /Users/$USER/Library/init/zsh 
will be read IN ADDITION TO the other files. The directories 
/sw/share/zsh/templates/Library/init/zsh/local-functions 
and /Library/init/zsh/local-functions are both in the 
$FPATH by default; a funtion of the same name in 
/Library/init/zsh/local-functions takes precedence over that 
in /sw/share/zsh/templates/Library/init/zsh/local-functions.  
This structure permits customizations that will be preserved 
during fink package upgrade. 
.
3. To change the prompt theme, issue the command "switch_prompt"
.
4. To use with /bin/zsh, copy or link the file
/sw/share/zsh/templates/etc/zshenv to /etc/zshenv and
likewise with /sw/share/zsh/templates/etc/zshrc to
/etc/zshrc.  These two files are both required and have been
designed in such a way that the should not require editing.
.
5. The faster-loading "open" completion function is now enabled
by default. However, to ensure it functions optimally, type the
command "enable_faster_open".  This requires an up-to-date
locate database to find the various Applications. It will
prompt you to update this.
.
6. By default, these scripts start Apple's X11.app (if you have it)
if it is not already running.  This behavior, as well as several
somewhat "hidden" features of X11.app, can be enabled or disabled
by issuing the command "customize_x11".
.
7. A brief description of the functions and completions
provided can be had by typing "help_template_functions"
optionally with the function name.  Only a subset are
autoloaded by default.  Load others individually by
uncommenting "autoload -U foo" lines or setting the appropriate
vairables indicated in the file functions.local.
.
Modifications and enhancements of zsh distributed templates 
were written by Gary Kerbaugh, W. G. Scott, Wataru Kagawa 
and several others. Completion functions _open, _fink, 
_hdiutils, _defaults and their dependencies were written by
Motoi Washida and will be included by default in future versions
of zsh.
