Package: hg-git-py%type_pkg[python]
Version: 0.3.2
Revision: 1
Type: python (2.5 2.6 2.7)
Description: Mercurial as a Git client
DescDetail: <<
	This is the Hg-Git plugin for Mercurial, adding the ability to push to
	and pull from a Git server repository from Mercurial. This means you
	can collaborate on Git based projects from Mercurial, or use a Git
	server as a collaboration point for a team with developers using both
	Git and Mercurial.
<<
DescUsage: <<
	Add the two lines
	hgext.bookmarks =
	hggit =
	to the [extensions] section of your ~/.hgrc file to enable.
	Use hg help hggit to check that it is installed correctly and
	get usage information.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
	This is the 0.3.2 release, but the tarball doesn't include any doc files,
	so download the equivalent snapshot from bitbucket instead.
