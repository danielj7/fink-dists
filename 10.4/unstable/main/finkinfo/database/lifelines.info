Description: Scriptable Genealogy program
DescDetail: <<
LifeLines is a genealogy program to help with your family history research. 
Its primarily strengths are its powerful scripting language and the various 
reports it includes.
<<
DescUsage: <<
Installs as "llines". Try the report programs in /sw/share/lifelines/reports/
<<
DescPort: <<
For some reason the current version tries to install its empty static lib.
So, I forcibly remove the thing.
