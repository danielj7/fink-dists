Description: Perl module for creating generic methods
DescPort: <<
 Sometime between version 2.02 and version 2.07, two things happened to
 this package:
  1) Some XS code was added, which means that we now need variant fink
     packages for the different perl versions, and
  2) A line INSTALLDIRS => "vendor", was added to Makefile.PL; this breaks
     the fink install (resulting in installation directly to /System !)
     so has been patched out.
