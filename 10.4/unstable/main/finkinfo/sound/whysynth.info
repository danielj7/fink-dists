DescDetail: <<

WhySynth is a versatile softsynth which operates as a plugin for the
Disposable Soft Synth Interface (DSSI).  A brief list of features:

- 4 oscillators, 2 filters, 3 LFOs, and 5 envelope generators per
    voice.

- 10 oscillator modes: minBLEP, wavecycle, asynchronous granular,
    three FM modes, waveshaper, noise, PADsynth, and phase
    distortion.

- 6 filter modes.

- flexible modulation and mixdown options.

WhySynth is something of a mongrel, combining bits from Xsynth-DSSI,
hexter, Csound, Mats Olsson's MSS, and various other programs, with
inspiration from a number of my favorite long-hair-days synths
(Matrix 6, ESQ-1, K4), and wavecycle data resynthesized from Claude
Kaber's Virtual K4 samples and //christian's exegesis of the Ensoniq
SQ-80 wavetable ROMs. See the enclosed file AUTHORS for more
details.
