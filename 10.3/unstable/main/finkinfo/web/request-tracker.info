RT is an enterprise-grade ticketing system which enables a group of
people to intelligently and efficiently manage tasks, issues, and
requests submitted by a community of users.

The RT platform has been under development since 1996, and is used by
systems administrators, customer support staffs, IT managers, developers
and marketing departments at thousands of sites around the world.

Written in object-oriented Perl, RT is a high-level, portable, platform
independent system that eases collaboration within organizations and
makes it easy for them to take care of their customers.

RT manages key tasks such as the identification, prioritization,
assignment, resolution and notification required by enterprise-critical
applications including project management, help desk, NOC ticketing, CRM
and software development.

RT is used by Fortune 100 companies, government agencies, educational
institutions, and development organizations worldwide.
