Description: Passive OS fingerprinting of network packets
DescDetail: <<
 p0f performs a passive OS fingerprinting technique based on information
 coming from a remote host when it establishes connection to our system.
 Captured packets contain enough information to determine the OS--and unlike
 active scanners (nmap, queSO) p0f accomplishes this without sending anything
 to the connecting host.

 Read Lance Spitzner's white paper on passive OS fingerprinting:

DescUsage: <<
 The p0f Log file can grow very quickly in a little as a day. For short-term
 use such as collecting data against a persistent intruder, you may not want
 to install the daemonic script and just start and stop it manually.

 Output is logged to a text file: %p/var/log/p0f.log. For long-term use
 consider rotating the logs daily or hourly with logrotate, depending on
 your network environment. Administrators intending to gather data on a long-
 term basis may consider using p0f with support for mysql.

 Manual Starting and Stopping:
 sudo %p/etc/init.d/p0f/p0f.init {start|stop|restart}

 Automatic Starting and Stopping:
 sudo daemonic enable p0f (creates StartupItem in /Library/StartupItems)
 sudo /Library/StartupItems/daemonic-p0f/daemonic-p0f start
 sudo %p/etc/init.d/p0f/p0f.init stop

 p0f.fp (fingerprint file).
<<
DescPort: <<
 Patched p0f.init script to recognize (nonstandard?) output from Apple's
 ifconfig, and removed BSD's init status command (not implemented in Darwin).
<<
DescPackaging: <<
 Patched hardcoded Makefile paths and p0f.init script paths.
 MySQL support not enabled in this package.
 p0f.fp is the fingerprint config file.
