Description: Library of Unicode annotation data
DescDetail: <<
  The Unicode consortium provides a file containing annotations on many
  unicode characters. This library contains a compiled version of this
  file so that programs can access these data easily.
  
  The library contains a very large (sparse) array with one entry for each
  unicode code point (U+0000 - U+10FFFF). Each entry contains two strings,
  a name and an annotation. Either or both may be NULL. The library also
  contains a (much smaller) list of all the Unicode blocks.
  
  Supports Unicode 5.2.
