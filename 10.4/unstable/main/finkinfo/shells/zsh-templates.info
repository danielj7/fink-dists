===============================================================================
These files work "out of the box" but you must set this up in one of two ways:

Method 1:  
==========

Make %p/bin/zsh your default user shell.  To do so, you must edit the file 
/etc/shells and add to it the line

 %p/bin/zsh 

Then issue the following command:

 chsh -s /sw/bin/zsh


Method 2:  
==========

Make /bin/zsh your default shell. To do this, issue 

 chsh -s /bin/zsh

Then create the following two symbolic links:

 sudo ln -s %p /share/zsh/templates/etc/zshenv /etc/.
 sudo ln -s %p /share/zsh/templates/etc/zshrc  /etc/.

===============================================================================
===============================================================================

A wiki for zsh-templates has now been created, describing
what is in the package in detail.  It can be visited at the
following URL: http://tinyurl.com/y3r4kp

To use vi keybindings instead of emacs, issue the command

 touch ~/.zshvi

To change the prompt theme, issue the command "switch_prompt"

The commands "user_setup" and "host_setup" can be invoked
to fine-tune username and hostname completions for ssh, scp,
switch_user, and so on.

You can customize the behavior of X11 by issuing 
"customize_x11" or "customize_x11_gui". Several
somewhat "hidden" features of X11.app can be enabled or disabled.

The command "gdirs" provides a gui interface to the directory
stack.  You can use an applescript-type interface instead of
a Pashua-type interface by creating a file ~/.zshenv and putting
into it the following line:
export GUIDIRS_PASHUA='no'

===============================================================================

Modifications and enhancements of zsh distributed templates 
were written by Gary Kerbaugh, W. G. Scott, Wataru Kagawa 
and several others. Completion functions _open, _fink, 
_hdiutils, _defaults and their dependencies were written by
Motoi Washida and will be included by default in future versions
of zsh. Some of these (_open, _fink) have been modified to work 
faster.
