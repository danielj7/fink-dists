Description: Units of physical quantities
DescPackaging: <<
Decided not just to use the "udunits" name, since this version builds 
shared libraries out of the box, and none of its files actually overlap
with the prior version's.  Also, upstream calls it "UDUNITS-2".
<<
DescDetail: <<
The UDUNITS-2 package provides support for units of physical quantities. 
Its three main components are: 
	1) a C library for units of physical quantities; 
	2) a utility; for obtaining the definition of a unit and for 
		converting numeric values between compatible units; and
	3) an extensive database of units.
