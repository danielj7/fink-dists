Description: Utility to apply patches to source trees
DescDetail: <<
patch takes a file describing differences (usually created by diff(1))
and applies them to a file or a whole source tree.
<<
DescPort: <<
Uses autoconf and checks the host type - the usual fix. Tries to use a
function called setmode() which is supposed to do something else than
the setmode(3) in *BSD. The patch removes the define from config.hin
(and thus from config.h).
