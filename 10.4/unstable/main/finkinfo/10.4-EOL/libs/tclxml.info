Package: tclxml
Version: 3.1
Revision: 1
Description: XML parsing routines for Tcl scripts
DescPort: <<
Some of the tests/tclxml.tcl tests fail, but this appears to be due to
syntax errors within the those scripts.

Make sure shared-library linker flags are passed to the linker.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
This compiles a shared library but places it in a private place and
uses it via dlopen-like pkgIndex.tcl mechanism, so considering it
private.
