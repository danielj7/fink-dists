DescPackaging: <<
  IPC::Run will use IO::Pty if it is present but it is apparently not
  required. If it is present, it must be >= 1.08. Fink doesn't have a
  clean way to express that dependency, and io-tty-pm (which contains
  IO::Pty) hasn't been < 1.00 in a long time, so not gonna worry about
  it. NB: io-tty-pm is perl-versioned, so we would have to be perl-
  versioned ourselves if we started messing with it explicitly.
