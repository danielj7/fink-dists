Description: Open Source Network Intrusion Detection
DescDetail: <<
Snort is a lightweight network intrusion detection system, capable of
performing real-time traffic analysis and packet logging on IP
networks.  It can perform protocol analysis, content
searching/matching and can be used to detect a variety of attacks and
probes, such as buffer overflows, stealth port scans, CGI attacks, SMB
probes, OS fingerprinting attempts, and much more. Snort uses a
flexible rules language to describe traffic that it should collect or
pass, as well as a detection engine that utilizes a modular plugin
architecture.  Snort has a real-time alerting capability as well,
incorporating alerting mechanisms for syslog, a user specified file, a
UNIX socket, or WinPopup messages to Windows clients using Samba's
smbclient.
