Description: DiskJuggler (.cdi) Image Converter
DescDetail: <<
A small tool which will scan and extract the contents of a DiscJuggler (both v2.0 and v3.0 versions) image. These images end with extension .CDI, hence the name. 

Many people has trouble with these images because of the lack of recorder support DiscJuggler has, so the purpose of this tool is allowing people to burn these images with another recording program, such as CDR-Win. I would recomment this program because of its good support for ISO and WAV track images. CDIrip will automatically generate a cuesheet ready for this program. Anyways, other software can be used, such as Fireburner and cdrecord.
