DescDetail: <<
setuptools is a collection of enhancements to the Python distutils
(for Python 2.3.5 and up on most platforms; 64-bit platforms require a
minimum of Python 2.4) that allow you to more easily build and
distribute Python packages, especially ones that have dependencies on
other packages.

Packages built and distributed using setuptools look to the user like
ordinary Python packages based on the distutils. Your users don't need
to install or even know about setuptools in order to use them, and you
don't have to include the entire setuptools package in your
distributions. By including just a single bootstrap module (an 8K .py
file), your package will automatically download and install setuptools
if the user is building your package from source and doesn't have a
suitable version already installed.

Skips using the egg and pth style install to make fink packagers'
lives easier.

Thanks to Phillip J. Eby for help with packaging setuptools.

May need to add support for /bin/easy_install that tracks the version
of python.  Hopefully since everything is "externally-managed" this
will not be necessary.
