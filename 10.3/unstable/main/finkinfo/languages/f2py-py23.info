Description: Fortran to Python Interface Generator
DescDetail: <<
 The Fortran to Python Interface Generator, or F2PY for short, is a
 command line tool (f2py) for generating Python C/API modules for
 wrapping Fortran 77/90/95 subroutines, accessing common blocks from
 Python, and calling Python functions from Fortran (call-backs).
 Interfacing subroutines/data from Fortran 90/95 modules is supported.

 The driver script is installed as f2py2.3.
 Installing the f2py23 package creates a symlink from f2py2.3 to f2py,
