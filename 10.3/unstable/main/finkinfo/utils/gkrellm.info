Description: System monitor stack for GTK
DescDetail: <<
GKrellM is a single process stack of system monitors which supports applying themes 
to match its appearance to your window manager, Gtk, or any other theme. There are
also many third party plugins that can monitor a wide variety of things.
<<
DescUsage: <<
Get themes at http://www.muhri.net/gkrellm/ and place them in your ~/.gkrellm/themes
directory to use.
<<
DescPort: <<
1.2.13-3: Fix Jaguar, and disk stats.
1.2.13-2: Fix plugin/themes directories so we support fink-installed addons.
1.2.13-1: Native OSX support.
Rev-4: Fix leading underscores for dlsym. Plugins work now.
Rev-3: Should fix CPU on single-cpu systems. Fix RAM display. Disk monitoring probably does 
not yet work.
Rev-1/2: Initial port to darwin (non-glibtop). Some things may not be working properly, such
as memory stats. Please test. Not yet tested with themes or plugins.
