Description: RNA database search for secondary structure motifs
DescDetail: <<
The rnamotif program searches a database for RNA sequences that match 
a "motif" describing secondary structure interactions. A match means that 
the given sequence is capable of adopting the given secondary structure, 
but is not intended to be predictive. Matches can be ranked by applying 
scoring rules that may provide finer distinctions than just matching to 
a profile. The rnamotif program is a (significant) extension of earlier 
programs rnamot and rnabob. The nearest-neighbor energies used in 
the scoring section are based on Turner's rules. The code was written by 
Tom Macke; Tom Macke and Dave Case wrote the Users' manual.
See home page for additional info and literature references.

There are four binaries:

        rnamotif        The actual serach program.
        rmprune         Remove hits that differ only by 'unzipped' base pairs.
        rmfmt           Format the output.
        rm2ct           Convert the output to ct-format suitable for drawing.
	
Usage is described in the README file
