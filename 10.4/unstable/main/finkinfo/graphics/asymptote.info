Description: Script-based vector graphics language
DescDetail: << 
 Asymptote is a powerful script-based vector graphics language for technical
 drawings, inspired by MetaPost but with an improved C++-like
 syntax. Asymptote provides for figures the same high-quality level of
 typesetting that LaTeX does for scientific text.
<<
DescUsage: <<
 The GUI "xasy" is a Python script. It runs with whatever "python"
 executable comes first in your PATH. It works both with the 
 system python (using aqua graphics) and with Fink's python
 (using X11 graphics), so you can choose which one you want to 
 use, by either manipulating your PATH, or by simply installing
 or uninstalling Fink's "python" package.  
<<
DescPort: <<
 This version uses opengl for 3D effects. 
 It must therefore depend on X11 and on freeglut, and it also uses the movie15 latex style.
 The configure script is not yet capable of finding the opengl and glut stuff without help.
