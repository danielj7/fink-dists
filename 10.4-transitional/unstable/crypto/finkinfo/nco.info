DescDetail: <<
	Each NCO operator (e.g., ncks) takes netCDF or HDF input file(s),
	performs an operation (e.g., averaging, hyperslabbing, or renaming),
	and outputs a processed netCDF file. Although most users of
	netCDF and HDF data are involved in scientific research,
	these data formats, and thus NCO, are generic and
	are equally useful in fields like finance.
	This version is OPeNDAP/DODS enabled, so it can be given
	URLs to read remote datasets as if they were local
	netCDF files.
