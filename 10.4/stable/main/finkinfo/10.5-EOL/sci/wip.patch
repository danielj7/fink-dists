+WIP Description
+---------------
+
+WIP is a graphics software package available (at least) on Sun
+Workstations, VAX/VMS systems, Linux machines, Cray/UNICOS, and CONVEX
+systems. WIP is intended to be used to generate high quality graphics
+(using the PGPLOT graphics library) with a minimum of effort.
+
+Restrictions on Use
+-------------------
+
+WIP is copyright by the Berkeley-Illinois-Maryland Association (BIMA)
+Project. All portions of WIP, including source code, may be used
+subject only to the following restrictions:

+
+3. Distribution of WIP requires formal notification to the WIP contact
+   listed below
+
+4. Receipt of WIP binds all recipients to the above restrictions and
+   to all restrictions on portions of WIP not developed by BIMA
+   (especially PGPLOT).
