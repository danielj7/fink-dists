DescPackaging: <<
	As of 2.6.8, -docs is separated into its own package. The
	helpfile build system needs to be able to run abiword.

	Because abiword's .pc is accessed, would need all the indirect
	deps of abiword even though we're not compiling anything. Only
	need a variable from the .pc, so make local copy with no deps.
