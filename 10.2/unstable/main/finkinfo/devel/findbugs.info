DescDetail: <<
FindBugs is a program to find bugs in Java programs.  It looks for
instances of "bug patterns" --- code instances that are likely to be
errors.

Changes since version 0.6.2

  * GUI supports filtering bugs by priority 
  * Ant task rewritten; supports all functionality offered by Text UI
    (contributed by Mike Fagan) 
  * Ant task is fully documented in the manual 
  * Classes in nested archives are analyzed; this allows full support for
    analyzing .ear and .war files (contributed by Mike Fagan) 
  * DepthFirstSearch changed to use non-recursive implementation;
    this should fix the StackOverflowErrors that several users
    reported 
  * Various minor bugfixes and improvements 

Changes since version 0.6.1

 * New detector to look for useless control flow (suggested by Richard
   P. King and Mike Fagan)
 * Look for places where return value of java.io.File.createNewFile()
   is ignored (suggested by Richard P. King)
 * Fixed bug in resolution of source files (only the first source
   directory was searched)
 * Fixed a NullPointerException in the bytecode pattern matching code
 * Ant task supports project files (contributed by Mike Fagan)
 * Unix findbugs script honors the JAVA_HOME environment variable
   (contributed by Pedro Morais)
 * Allow .war and .ear files to be analyzed

Changes since version 0.6.0

 * New bug pattern detector which looks for places where a null
   pointer might be dereferenced
 * New bug pattern detector which looks for IO streams that are
   opened, do not escape the method, and are not closed on all paths out
   of the method
 * New bug pattern detector to find methods that can return null
   instead of a zero-length array
 * New bug pattern detector to find places where the == or !=
   operators are used to compare String objects
 * Command line interface can save bugs as XML
 * GUI can save bugs to and load bugs from XML 
 * An "Annotations" window in the GUI allows the user to add textual
   annotations to bug reports; these annotations are preserved when bugs
   are saved as XML
 * In this release, the Japanese bug summary translations by Germano
   Leichsenring are really included (they were inadvertently omitted in
   the previous release)
 * Completely rewrote the control flow graph builder, hopefully for
   the last time
 * Simplified implementation of control flow graphs, which should
   reduce memory use and possibly improve performance
 * Improvements to command line interface (list bug priorities, filter
   by priority, specify aux classpath, specify project to analyze)
 * Various bug fixes and enhancements

DescPackaging: <<
Although findbugs itself is released under the LGPL, the findbugs and
mergeResults scripts contain code "shamelessly stolen from Ant's
'bin/ant' script" and are thus released under the Apache Software
License. That is why the license field is "OSI-Approved"

The weird thing is that this ant code is actually removed in the
patch phase, since it is not required if we know where the scripts are
installed (as we do with fink)
