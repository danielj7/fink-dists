Description: C++ Port of JUnit framework for unit testing
DescDetail: <<
CppUnit is a C++ unit testing framework.  It started its life as a
port of JUnit.

Features:
- XML output with hook for additional data
- Compiler like text output to integrate with an IDE
- Helper macros for easier test suite declaration
- Hierarchical test fixture support
- Test registry to reduce compilation need
- Test plug-in for faster compile/test cycle (self testable dynamic library)
- Protector to encapsulate test execution (allow capture of exception
	not derived from std::exception)
- MfcTestRunner
- QT based graphic test runner
<<
DescPackaging: <<
 This version is compiled with g++-3.3, even in the 10.4 tree.  If it is
 ever updated to a more recent compiler, any packages which depend on
 this one must be updated at the same time.
