Revision: 1

Description: Python bindings for db53
DescDetail: <<
	This module provides a nearly complete wrapping of the Oracle/Sleepycat
	C API for the Database Environment, Database, Cursor, Sequence and
	Transaction objects, and each of these is exposed as a Python type in
	the bsddb3.db module. The database objects can use various access
	methods: btree, hash, recno, and queue. Complete support of Berkeley DB
	distributed transactions. Complete support for Berkeley DB Replication
	Manager. Complete support for Berkeley DB Base Replication. Support for
	RPC.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
	Switch back to using db53 since db60 has licensing issues.
	bsddb3 will only allow building with db60 if you set an environment
	variable at build time saying that you are licensed to do so.
	
	Numerous test failures with py35.
