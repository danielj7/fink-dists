DescDetail: <<
This is a quick implementation of the minimal interface to Readline libraries.
The implementation is made in Perl (mostly) by Jeffrey Friedl. The only thing
this library does is to make it conformant (and add some minimal changes, like
using Term::ReadKey if present, and correct work under xterm).
