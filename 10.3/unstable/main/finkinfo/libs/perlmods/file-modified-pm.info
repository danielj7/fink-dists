DescDetail: <<
The Modified module is intended as a simple method for programs
to detect whether configuration files (or modules they rely on)
have changed.  There are currently two methods of change
detection implemented, mtime and MD5.  The MD5 method will fall
back to use timestamps if the Digest::MD5 module cannot be loaded.

There is another module, File::Signature, which has many similar
features, so if this module doesn't do what you need, maybe
File::Signature does.  There also is quite some overlap between
the two modules, code wise.
