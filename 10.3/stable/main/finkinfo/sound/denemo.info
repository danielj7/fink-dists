Description: Graphical musical score editor
DescPackaging: <<
 This version is compiled with g++-3.3, even in the 10.4 tree.  If it is
 ever updated to a more recent compiler, any packages which depend on
 this one must be updated at the same time.
<<
DescDetail: <<
Denemo is the GNU graphical musical score editor, and serves as a frontend to
Lilypond. 
Though its behavior and features will no doubt continue to be refined, it is
already perfectly usable.
<<
DescUsage: <<
	*** The provided keymapping is somewhat different from the one described
	in share/doc/denemo/README because of the way the keyboard is mapped in
 XDarwin.
	Note also that the keymapping was done on a french keyboard so everything may
 not work for you.
	You can refer to .denemo/keymaprc in your home directory for more details.

DescPort: <<
