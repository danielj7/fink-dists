Description: Honeypot for catching malware/scriptkiddies
DescDetail: <<
  Nepenthes is a low interaction honeypot like honeyd or mwcollect. Low
  Interaction Honeypots emulate _known_ vulnerabilities to collect information
  about potential attacks. Nepenthes is designed to emulate vulnerabilties
  worms use to spread, and to capture these worms. As there are many
  possible ways for worms to spread, Nepenthes is modular. There are module
  interfaces to
  - resolve dns asynchronously
  - emulate vulnerabilities
  - download files
  - submit the downloaded files
  - trigger events (sounds abstract and it is abstract but is still quite
    useful)
  - shellcode handler
