Description: Graphical IRC client (with SSL)
DescDetail: <<
XChat is a graphical IRC client for UNIX operating systems (I.R.C. is Internet
Relay Chat, see http://irchelp.org for more information about IRC in general).
It runs under the X Window System and uses the GTK+2 toolkit.
<<
DescPort: <<
No -lutil is available nor required for the python plugin; thus I removed it
(and the -lpthread), which fixes the python plugin.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
Disabled DBUS since there currently is no package for it, and we need to
avoid hidden dependencies should it ever is packaged.

Although this package has a GPL license, it is marked Restrictive since
it links to openssl.
