Description: Graphics generation library
DescDetail: <<
 The GD library is useful for creating graphics like hit counters on
 the fly. This version supports the PNG, JPEG and WBMP formats and lets
 you use TrueType fonts rendered via freetype2.

 The 2.x.x series of gd is still labeled as beta software, so use with
 caution.
<<
DescPort: <<
 One file includes malloc.h, disabled. The created library is now dynamic
 (must be compiled with the -fno-common switch), and the Makefile had to
 be heavily hacked for changes from ELF systems to Darwin.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
 This package is based on previous work by Chris Pepper, Jeremy Higgs
 and Peter O'Gorman.  Previously maintained by Christoph Pfisterer.
