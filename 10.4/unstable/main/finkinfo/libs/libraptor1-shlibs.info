DescPackaging: <<
	Make sure system-openssl flags always come first

	Checks for both libxml and expat, but uses libxml and not expat
	if both are found. Dependencies for libxml, therefore don't care
	about expat result and don't need deps for it.

DescDetail: <<
Raptor is a free software / Open Source C library that provides a set
of parsers and serializers that generate Resource Description
Framework (RDF) triples by parsing syntaxes or serialize the triples
into a syntax. The supported parsing syntaxes are RDF/XML, N-Triples,
Turtle, RSS tag soup including Atom 1.0 and 0.3, GRDDL for XHTML and
XML. The serializing syntaxes are RDF/XML (regular, and abbreviated),
N-Triples, RSS 1.0, Atom 1.0 and Adobe XMP.

Raptor was designed to work closely with the Redland RDF library (RDF
Parser Toolkit for Redland) but is entirely separate. It is a portable
library that works across many POSIX systems (Unix, GNU/Linux, BSDs,
OSX, cygwin, win32). Raptor has no memory leaks and is fast.
