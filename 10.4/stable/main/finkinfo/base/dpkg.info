Description: The Debian package manager
DescDetail: <<
dpkg installs and removes binary packages; it is the base of the
distribution. This package also contains some helper programs and
dselect, a full-screen console frontend to dpkg.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
 With the current fink dependency engine, essential packages may neither
 depend nor builddepend on non-essential packages.  Thus, to make sure
 that non-essential splitoffs of essential packages (like gettext-bin
 and *-dev) are present at build time, we call 'fink install' during
 the compile script.  Note that since the corresponding essential packages
 are dependencies of this one, they should already have been built, so
 'fink install' should merely make sure they are in place.

 We now build gettext-tools during the build of dpkg, but don't install it;
 it is built only so that msgfmt and xgettext are available during the
 dpkg build.  The only alternative would be to make gettext-tools an essential
 pakcages, since essential packages cannot depend or builddepend on
 non-essential packages.

DescPort: <<
1.10.9 
- Removed --without-zlib flag
- Gets confused about top_srcdir without the --srcdir arg.
- Fixed bug with BR manpage
- Patched update-rc.d out of the app check code, not needed on OS X.

Pre-Jaguar: Needed fixes to use the right architecture, disable code that uses
unimplemented functions on Darwin and other stuff.

Added code to support the pseudo package 'macosx' and 'darwin'.

Fix to install-info script to prevent a certain problem with section titles.

Patched to run 'fink-virtual-pkgs' to see what packages we have outside of $prefix.

Patched to suppress warning about BuildDependsOnly control field.

Previous versions by Christoph Pfisterer.

Patched to not remove Darwin's system-critical symlinks (/etc /tmp /var)

Patched to hardcode complete paths to our component executables
instead of relying on PATH
