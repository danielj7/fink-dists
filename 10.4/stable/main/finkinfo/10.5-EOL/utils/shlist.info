DescDetail: <<
shlist allows the use of lists from a shell. Lists take the form of a list 
name and an index, which may be a name.  Lists are kept in a directory 
(~/.listRoot by default) with the indexes as filenames, and keep their 
contents across reboots.  Any number of separate list databases may be set up 
at a time.

DescUsage: <<
See README for details.  

Usage:
  shlist [-vrRslLF] [-n <name>] [-o <index>|-c <column>] [<value>|-]
  shlist [-vrRslLF] [-n <name>] [-o <index>|-c <column>] [-f] [<filename>|-]

-r          - reset the index. (Deletes the entry).
-R          - reset the list. (Deletes the directory supplied with -n or 
              LIST_NAME variable).  
-s          - supress the display of the current value.
-l          - list the indexes
-L          - list the indexes and their values
-F          - when displaying, displays the name of the file containing the 
              value
-f          - requires a filename. The file is copied as the index file.
-n <name>   - name of list. See note below for defaults.
-o <index>  - index into array. Default is 0.
-c <column> - denotes that stdin is to be used and the number is the column 
              (or field) number to use for the index. Column 0 is the first 
              column.
-v          - writes the version number to stderr.

DescPackaging: <<
Patched shlist.sh use execute using /usr/sh, and removed the output to ofile, 
which is unnecessary.  Patched shlist.sh wrapper section of README to make it 
clearer.
