DescDetail: <<
Ebib is a BibTeX database manager running in Emacs. With Ebib, a user
can create and manage .bib-files, all within Emacs. It supports
@string and @preamble definitions, multi-line field values, searching,
and integration with Emacs' (La)TeX mode.

In more detail:

Ebib is a program with which you can manage a BibTeX database. There
are already quite a few such programs, but Ebib has a special
property: it runs inside Emacs. If you are used to doing everything
(La)TeX from within Emacs, you may appreciate that you can manage your
.bib file in Emacs as well. One distinct advantage of Ebib is that you
do not need to switch to another window and copy/paste a BibTeX key
into your LaTeX file with the mouse. Ebib provides a function with
which you can select a key from the database by using tab-completion
and have it inserted directly into your LaTeX text.

Ebib is fully keyboad-operated. Unlike other BibTeX database managers,
you do not need the mouse at all. Everything Ebib can do can be
accomplished with simple one-key commands. This makes using Ebib much
faster than other similar programs, which are usually
mouse-operated. And because Emacs does not have to run under X, Ebib
as well can be used without X, unlike other BibTeX database
managers. (At least the ones that I know of.)

Ebib provides the standard capabilities that one would expect from a
BibTeX database manager: .bib files can be opened, modified (adding,
deleting, modifying entries), searched, and saved. Obviously, it is
also possible to start a new database from scratch. A nice property is
the ability to copy single entries to another .bib file: this makes it
possible to create a new .bib file from a subset of the entries of an
existing database. This can be useful e.g. when you want to create a
.bib file for a paper containing only the works cited in that paper.

Features:

* runs in GNU Emacs and XEmacs.
* format of the .bib file is not restricted: everything that BibTeX
  accepts is also accepted by Ebib.
* multiple .bib files can be opened at the same time: copying entries
  from one file to another is possible.
* allows creation and editing of @string and @preamble definitions.
* BibTeX entry and field types can be customised through a
  configuration file, allowing adaptation for non-standard and
  personal bibliography styles.
* visual representation distinguishing required, optional and ignored
  fields.
* field values containing newlines are supported, allowing the
  creation of annotated bibliographies.
* merging of a second .bib file with an already loaded database.
* single entries can be exported to another file, allowing the
  creation of a new specialised .bib file from an existing
  one. @preamble and @string definitions can also be exported.
* searching a database for specific strings (regexes in fact).
* copy/cut/paste mechanism for quickly copying field values. (This
  integrates with Emacs' kill ring.)
* automatic insertion of a BibTeX key into a (La)TeX document, where
  the user can use tab completion to select a key from the database.
* automatic loading of .bib files upon startup.
* on-line help function summarising the available commands.
* extensive user manual.

Limitations:

There are a few limitations to Ebib that you may need to be aware
of. Some of these will be addressed in a future version:

* @comment definitions are ignored when a database is opened. Ebib
  will not complain if it finds them, but it does not store or save
  them.
