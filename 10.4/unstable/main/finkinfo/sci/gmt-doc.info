 Documents and examples for GMT.

 GMT is an open source collection of ~60 tools for manipulating
 geographic and Cartesian data sets (including filtering, trend
 fitting, gridding, projecting, etc.) and producing Encapsulated
 PostScript File (EPS) illustrations ranging from simple x-y plots
 via contour maps to artificially illuminated surfaces and 3-D
 perspective views. GMT supports ~30 map projections and transformations
 and comes with support data such as coastlines, rivers, and political
 boundaries.
