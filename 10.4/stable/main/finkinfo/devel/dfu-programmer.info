DescDetail: <<
A command-line programmer for Atmel chips with a USB bootloader
supporting in system programming. This is a mostly Device Firmware
Update (DFU) 1.0 compliant user-space application.

This program was created because the Atmel FLIP program for flashing
devices only runs on Windows and standard DFU loaders do not work for
Atmel chips.
