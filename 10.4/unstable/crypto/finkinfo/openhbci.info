DescDetail: <<
OpenHBCI is a client-side implementation of the HBCI specification. 
That means, you can use openHCBI in a homebanking application to connect 
and talk to any HBCI-capable bank server.

OpenHBCI provides an object oriented library to give you easy access to 
credit institutes that support the HBCI-standard. The library is written 
in C++, and C wrappers are provided as well. OpenHBCI hides all the 
protocol-stuff, the encryption, the communication... so that developers 
of homebanking-software can concentrate on their application without 
having to read about 700 pages of specification.
<<
DescPort: <<
Patch configure for building c++ shared libraries -bind_at_load, ltmain.sh for
the convenience library bug.
Does not depend on libchipcard, because I don't have a chipcard reader, nor
a driver for one.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
 Although this package has a LGPL license, it is marked Restrictive since
 it links to openssl.

 Patching configure updates its timestamp, which triggers autoheader
 to run. Updating timestamp on config.h.in suppresses that (we didn't
 change anything in configure that would affect config.h.in).
