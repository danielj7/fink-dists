DescDetail: <<
HotWayd is a POP3-HTTPMail gateway. HTTPMail is an undocumented 
WebDAV-based protocol used by hotmail. This gateway allows *any* POP3 
compatible email client to handle (download, delete, etc) messages on 
hotmail.com and on msn.com.

This software is useful to access Hotmail in applications such as
Mail.app or Eudora.
