Description: Object-oriented unit testing framework
DescDetail: <<
Mock Objects is a test-first development process for building object-oriented
software and a generic unit testing framework that supports that process.
Mock objects give you:

    * A methodology for developing and using mock objects.
    * A core mock objects framework. This is a library of code that supports the
      implementation of mock objects.  It is based around a set of expectation
      classes for values and collections.  There are also various other classes
      to make mock objects easier to write or to use.
    * A default set of mock implementations for the standard Java platform APIs.
      We have made a start on packages such as servlets, sql, and io.
