Description: High-level interface to cddb protocol servers
DescDetail: <<
This module provides a high-level Perl interface to cddbp servers.
With it, a Perl program can identify and possibly gather details about
a CD based on its "table of contents" (the disc's track times and offsets).

Disc details have been useful for generating CD catalogs, naming mp3 
files, printing CD liners, or even just playing discs in an automated 
jukebox
<<
DescUsage: <<
  If you want to submit track data, you must install Fink's
  mailtools-pmXXX and libwww-pmXXX packages, where XXX corresponds to
  the version of perl you are using (5123 (for perl5.12.3) is most
  likely on OS X 10.8, for example).
<<
DescPort: <<
  make test removed by Justin Hallett
  it seems that the cddb site has changed and thus break the tests, this should
  be fixed in the next release
  dmacks concurs: don't want to require network connectivity in order to compile
