Description: CCP4 Macromolecular Coordinate Library
DescDetail: <<
MMDB is CCP4's Macromolecular Coordinate Library written by Eugene
Krissinel at the EBI.  Note that official mmdb as distributed by Eugene 
does not install and does conform to normal "unix" standard notions of 
the behaviour of include and libraries. This version of mmdb has been
packaged with a GNU configure script and installs things canonically.
