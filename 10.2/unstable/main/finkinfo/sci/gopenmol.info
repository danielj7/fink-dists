Package: gopenmol
Version: 2.30
Revision: 3
Description: Molecular visualization and analysis program
DescDetail: <<
With gOpenMol small molecules, and to lesser extent protein
structures, as well as the chemical properties, total electron
densities and molecule orbitals of small molecules can be visualized
and analyzed. Data from a variety of computational chemistry programs
such as TurboMole, Gaussian, Gamess, etc., can be analyzed if the
output files from these programs have been converted into the
.plt-file format understood by gOpenMol. Moreover, dynamics done with,
e.g., InsightII can be visualized and a short mpeg animation of the
dynamics files generated.

A bug in the %p/bin/tclsh from tcltk-8.4.1-2 causes tclsh to emit
DOS-style line-endings (\r\n) when used in a pipeline. This breaks
parsing of its output by configure. Tcl/Tk folks know and are working
on it. For now, just patch configure to fix the line-endings (in a way
that will continue working when bug is fixed).

Darwin has no malloc.h, so discard all #include of it. But malloc()
needs sys/types.h for size_t. The recommended replacement for malloc.h
is stdlib.h (which brings along size_t for us) so #include that as
necessary.

Darwin (gcc) cpp doesn't seem to like null parameters to macros, so fix
the last param IMPLEMENT_GET_MODIFIABLE_POINTER in trajectory.c to
something harmless.

OTOH, GOM_PARSER_RETRIEVE_SELECTIONLIST is only a mild warning? But it
does cause a cpp-precomp segfault (not necessarily cause/effect). Apple
engineers say just -no-cpp-precomp and get on with our life; so be it.

I don't understand why when set_show in config.mk causes ": command
not found" when show=':', but making it always 'echo' seems to allow
the install.mk install-data-dir target to proceed.

The build/install process doesn't understand how to install in a temp
packaging location for later installation somewhere else, so need to
fix the pathnames in some runtime scripts.

Package installs lots of docs in its private hierarchies, so move to
or make links from the standard share/doc/%n location.

Patch install.mk to not install libs that we already have from other
Fink packages. Set our Depends for each of those packages >= version
that comes in Source tarball.

Put libgopenmol.* in lib instead of private bin. Still in its private
space since I don't know version info (so leave -avoid-version) so
cannot do -shlibs.

Patch plugins/config.mk.ac to link plugins as shared libraries
(.dylib) instead of bundles (.so), obeying dyld error message given
when using default options. Patch data/{gopenmol_guirc,gopenmolrc}.tcl
to use the platform-correct lib extension.

The "plugin...load" routine for the libfilters plugin was removing the
menu item for libsymmetry instead of for itself. Patched a mistake in
filters.tcl to fix this.

Some plugins fail to load (libfilters and libfchk) because "couldn't
find procedure {Filters,Fchk}_Init" (during a tcl "load" call for the
.dylib). These functions exist in the associated source file, so there
must be something weird going on with symbol exposure. Also libvrml
fails to load with 'invalid command name "command"'.

Fix g77 options to allow full-width lines in utility/UHBD/*.f

Fix flag passing in utility.mk.

Fix read() format in utility/convert.f (my best guess).

Many problems while compiling icon8/icon8.f. Add flag to reduce
argument-type-difference errors (for MOVLAP(), HUCKEL(), BANGIT()) to
warnings and hope for the best. The allocatable:: attribute and
allocate() call are F90 things that do not exist in our g77. Fink has
a gfortran package that is a (partial) implementation of F95, but
using that as the compiler gives other numberous error messages.

No default $TMP or $TMPDIR, so set GOM_TEMP in environment.txt to
user's own.

The rungOpenMol script just sets vars and calls the actual gopenmol,
so put the vars in a profile.d and patch install.mk to not bother with
the wrapper. Move the actual binary into %p/bin.

The internal command is "identify" but the GUI tries to call it as
"indentify". Patch parser/p_s_atomc.c to fix (will be fixed in a
future version).

Utility programs are in %p/lib/gOpenMol-%v/bin so you have to either
add that to yout PATH or call the programs using the full pathname.
This is so we don't conflict with (for example) imagemagick's convert
program. This will eventually be handled automatically via a splitoff
for placing these programs in PATH and/or using alternatives.
