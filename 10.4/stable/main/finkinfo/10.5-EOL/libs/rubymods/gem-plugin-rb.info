DescDetail: <<
GemPlugin is a system that lets your users install gems and lets you load
them as additional features to use in your software.  It originated from the
Mongrel (http://mongrel.rubyforge.org) project but proved useful enough to
break out into a separate project.

GemPlugin works by listing the gems installed, and doing a require_gem on 
any that have the right dependencies.  For example, if a gem depends on
"gem_plugin" and "mongrel" then it'll load as a Mongrel plugin.  This
makes it so that users of the plugins only need to gem install (and maybe
config a bit), and plugin authors only need to make gems.
