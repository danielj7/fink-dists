Description: Python zip packaging
DescDetail: <<
A built-package format for Python.

A wheel is a ZIP-format archive with a specially formatted filename
and the .whl extension. It is designed to contain all the files for a
PEP 376 compatible install in a way that is very close to the on-disk
format. Many packages will be properly installed with only the
"Unpack" step (simply extracting the file onto sys.path), and the
unpacked archive preserves enough information to "Spread" (copy data
and scripts to their final locations) at any later time.
