# Additional Info:
DescDetail: <<
You probably think YAML stands for "Yet Another Markup Language". It ain't!
YAML is really a data serialization language. But if you want to think of it as
a markup, that's OK with me. A lot of people try to use XML as a serialization
format.

DescPackaging: <<
Tests disabled since they need a newer test-simple-pm module (>= 0.54-1).
If the test-simple-pm module is too old, the tests will hang and fill all
system memory.
