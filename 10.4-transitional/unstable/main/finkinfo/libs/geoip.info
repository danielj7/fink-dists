Description: IP address to country lookup tool
DescUsage: <<
GeoIP is a C library that enables the user to find the country that any
IP address or hostname originates from.  It contains a free GeoIP Country
database that is updated every month.  This database simply contains IP
blocks as keys, and countries as values.  This database should be more
complete and accurate than using reverse DNS lookups.  We also offer a paid
database that has greater accuracy than the free version, as well as paid
databases with city level resolution.  For more details see:
