DescDetail: <<
	Lopster is a Napster Client developed in Cusing the GTK user interface.
	Napster is a protocol for sharing MP3 files between users. With Napster,
	the files stay on the client machine, never passing through the server.
	The server provides the ability to search for particular files and
	initiate a direct transfer between the clients. In addition, chat forums
	similar to IRC are available.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
	Facilities added for launching the Mac OS X default browser, sharing certain
	file types common on OS X (mp4, sit, dmg, hqx ...), and pinging with
	OS X's 'ping' utility.
