# This is a hack to prevent jamvm from installing its own version of /include/jni.h,
# which conflicts with the GNU Classpath version in the same location.

	make install prefix=%i
  rm -f %i/include/jni.h

# jamvm includes a dylib, but it's used by jamvm itself and isn't
# intended to be shared. Therefore, a -shlibs SplitOff isn't necessary.

DescDetail: <<
JamVM is a new Java Virtual Machine which conforms to the JVM specification
version 2 (blue book). In comparison to most other VM's (free and commercial)
it is extremely small, with a stripped executable on PowerPC of only ~150K, and
Intel 110K. However, unlike other small VMs (e.g. KVM) it is designed to
support the full specification, and includes support for object finalization,
Soft/Weak/Phantom References, the Java Native Interface (JNI) and the
Reflection API.
