DescDetail: <<
 Pine development ended with version 4.64, when Pine evolved into the
 upwards-compatible replacement Alpine. Alpine has also been forked into
 re-alpine and development of alpine stopped at the 2.0 release.

 This package is a stub for users who had previously installed pine to
 be migrated to re-alpine automatically.
