Mathomatic is a small, portable symbolic math program that can
automatically solve, simplify, differentiate, combine, and compare
algebraic equations, perform polynomial and complex arithmetic, etc.

DescPort: <<
Compile with readline support for generic Unix.

This thing is very noisy under -Wall: lots of implicit forward
function declarations and forgetting to declare void function return
types. Ain't gonna fix it.
