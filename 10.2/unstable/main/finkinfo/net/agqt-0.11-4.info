Description: 6's Spiffy All-giFT Query Tool
DescDetail: <<
 This program will go on All-Music Guide or FreeDB 
 to look up song lists for complete albums, 
 then automatically queue each of those songs on giFT.
<<
DescPort:<<
 Replacing g++ by c++ had to be done twice, because g++ is also used by the 
 implicit rules of make.
 Stacksize had to be upped from the default 512kB. 
<<
DescUsage:<<
 The 3 command line tools "ag", "am", "fdb" print short 
   usage instructions when used without arguments.
 The README file contains detailed instructions for the usage of the two
   command line tools "ag" and "am".
 "fdb" is new since version 0.9; it is like "am", except it uses 
   FreeDB instead of AllMusic Guide. 
 The "hammer" utility is included now, too. 
   See the ChangeLog file for a description.
   
 Since version 0.10, agqt now contains the tcl/tk based GUI agqt.tcl. 
   To use it, you have to have the fink package tcltk installed.
   You need to have X11 running.
   To start the GUI, type "agqt.tcl".
   
 You need to create a .agrc file in your home directory. 
   A sample file "agrc.sample" is supplied.
