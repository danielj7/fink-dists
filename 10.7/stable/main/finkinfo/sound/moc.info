DescDetail: <<
MOC (music on console) is a console audio player for LINUX/UNIX 
designed to be powerful and easy to use.

You just need to select a file from some directory using the menu 
similar to Midnight Commander, and MOC will start playing all files 
in this directory beginning from the chosen file. There is no need 
to create playlists as in other players.

However if you want to combine some files from one or more directories 
on one playlist, you can still do it. The playlist will be remembered 
between runs or you can save it as an m3u file and load it whenever you 
want.

Need the console where MOC is running for more important things? Need to 
close the X terminal emulator? You don't have to stop listening to the 
music - just press q and the interface will be detached leaving the 
server running. You can reattach it later, or you can attach one interface 
in the console, and another in the X terminal emulator, no need to switch 
just to play another file.

DescUsage: <<
Mocp uses jackd as the default audio server. To start the jackd server, run:

jackd -d coreaudio

Mocp can then be started with this command:

mocp [-m MUSIC DIR]

To stop the mocp server:

mocp -x

Config file goes in ~/.moc/config.  See %p/share/doc/moc/config.example
for a sample file.
