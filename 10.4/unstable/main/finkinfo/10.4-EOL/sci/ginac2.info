Description: C++ Library for Embedded Symbolic Computation
DescDetail: <<
GiNaC is a C++ library.  
It is designed to allow the creation of integrated systems that embed 
symbolic manipulations together with more established areas of computer 
science (like computation- intense numeric applications, graphical 
interfaces, etc.) under one roof.
.
It has been developed to become a replacement engine for xloops which in the 
past was powered by the Maple CAS.  
Its design is revolutionary in a sense that contrary to other CAS it does not 
try to provide extensive algebraic capabilities and a simple programming 
language but instead accepts a given language (C++) and extends it by a set 
of algebraic capabilities. 
.
It is distributed under the terms and conditions of the GNU general public 
license (GPL).
.
The name GiNaC is an iterated and recursive abbreviation for 
GiNaC is Not a CAS, where CAS stands for Computer Algebra System.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
Only the ginsh program depends on readline-shlibs, whereas libginac does not.
Configure checks for doxygen, [pdf]latex, fig2dev (transfig), autogen, but
these are for generating documentation which is alread distributed (I think).
pkgconfig is used to detect CLN.
