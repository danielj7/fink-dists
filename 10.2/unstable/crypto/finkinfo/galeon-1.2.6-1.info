Description: Light-weight GNOME web browser
DescDetail: <<
Galeon is a GNOME web browser based on Gecko (the Mozilla rendering engine. 
It's fast, it has a light interface, and it is fully standard-compliant.
<<
DescPort: <<
* In info file:
	- Use -no-cpp-precomp so it compiles.
	- Some header in glib #defines NULL to '(void*)0'. This makes the
		compiler complain about implicit conversions from (void*) to
		other pointer types. Fixed by defining NULL to '0L'.
	- Tells the configure scripts about Fink's custom locations for Mozilla.

* In patch file:
	- Galeon is called with --no-xshm to stop everything from looking black.
	- Forces libgaleon to build as a module, not a shared lib.
	- Adds location of mozilla libs to DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH, not LD_...

* Special thanks to:
	- Masanori Sekino (msek) for the ports of gconf, gnome-vfs, mozilla and
		other dependencies of galeon, for fixing the bugs that got
		in the way, and for his localtime_r() implementation.
		And for generally making everything else work better!
	- Blizzard_HWC for his simultaneous port, and for suggesting starting
		galeon in %p/lib as a bug workaround.
	- Everyone who has found a bug!

* Old changes:
	- Depends on updated version of gconf, allowing gconfd to load properly.
	- Depends on updated version of gdk-pixbuf.

##
DescPackaging: <<
- Forces man pages to install in %p/share/man.
- Adds some docs to %p/share/doc.
- Automatically uses the --no-xshm option when called from the startup script
	(%p/bin/galeon), to avoid having icons appear in all black.
- Removes scrollkeeper-update in makefile, puts in Post[Inst|Rm]Script.
