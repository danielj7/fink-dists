Description: Remote mail folder access server
DescDetail: <<
 IMAP (the Interactive Mail Access Protocol) is a mechanism for
 accessing mail folders and the messages in them remotely, i.e. with your
 user mail program running on a different machine to the one where all
 the messages are stored.

 Includes a POP server with the ability to relay commands to an IMAP server.

 You may find this useful with Mac OS X 10.2 (Jaguar) since Apple's Mail
 1.2 (v544/543) no longer allows local unix mailbox accounts.

 If you installed the 'pine' mail client then an imapd and ipopd binaries
 have already been installed too. In that case you need not install this
 package unless you need the additional 'mailutil' binary and other
 utilities. Unfortunately UW does not provide pine and imapd packages
 that have no overlap of products (or even a full overlap, which would make
 it easier for maintainers to add complete splitoff packages).

 If you do install uw-imapd you will almost certainly want to install a
 Mail Transfer Agent such as Smail or Sendmail, as remote mail programs
 which use IMAP to access incoming and saved mail will usually want to
 send mail using SMTP, often to the same machine.

DescUsage: <<
 To enable the IMAP daemon:

 1. Add a line to inetd.conf:
 imap stream tcp nowait root /usr/libexec/tcpd /sw/sbin/imapd

 (See the enclosed BUILD document for similar instructions to setup the
 additional pop daemons.)

 2. Reset (HUP) inetd:
 sudo kill -HUP `cat /var/run/inetd.pid`

 Unfortunately no instructions were provided with imapd to configure xinetd
 (a modern replacement for inetd, included with Mac OS X 10.2).
 To use imapd with xinetd, create the file '/etc/xinetd.d/imap' and insert
 the following:

service imap
{
	disable		= no
	flags		= REUSE
	socket_type	= stream
	protocol	= tcp
	wait		= no
	user		= root
	server		= /sw/sbin/imapd
}

 If xinetd is not already running, start it with the following command:
  sudo /usr/sbin/xinetd
 If xinetd is already running, restart it with:
  sudo kill -HUP `cat /var/run/xinetd.pid`

 IMPORTANT: DO NOT CONFIGURE BOTH inetd AND xinetd FOR imapd!

 Use make osx SSLTYPE=none as SSLTYPE=nopwd is now the default in RC7.

 Bypass interactive build and display notice of "NON-COMPLIANCE with IESG
 security requirements" in DescDetail instead.

 Better way to install DocFiles subdirectories?
