DescDetail: <<
JamVM is a new Java Virtual Machine which conforms to the JVM specification
version 2 (blue book). In comparison to most other VM's (free and commercial)
it is extremely small, with a stripped executable on PowerPC of only ~150K, and
Intel 110K. However, unlike other small VMs (e.g. KVM) it is designed to
support the full specification, and includes support for object finalisation,
Soft/Weak/Phantom References, the Java Native Interface (JNI) and the
Reflection API.
