Description: Framework for JSR175 Annotations
DescDetail: <<
Annogen is a tool which helps you work with JSR175 annotations, a new feature
in JDK 1.5. JSR175 is a much-needed improvement to Java. However, a few
challenges may lie in store for developers of frameworks which need to process
JSR175 annotations (hereafter, simply called frameworks). Annogen aims to
provide an elegant solution for the following problems: annotation overriding,
migration to JSR175 from older JDKs, and disparate access models.
