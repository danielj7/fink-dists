Description: Jupiter ACE emulator
DescDetail: <<
This emulator was made by Edward Patel. The Jupiter ACE is the real
*outsider* micro from the 80's. Instead of having BASIC as the
programming language it had FORTH. It was designed by two guys who had
worked at Sinclair Research Ltd and was responsible for the famous
Sinclair ZX81 and ZX Spectrum. They are Steven Vickers and Richard
Altwasser.  For a FAQ (1999) see
