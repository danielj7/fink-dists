DescPackaging: <<
Use the system's 'makeinfo' to build the documentation, because the doc sources
appear not to be compatible with texinfo-5.x

Keep sbcl Type in sync with that in sbcl-maxima-*.info.

Automatically removes obsolete sbcl-M-maxima versions after install.

Pkg in crypto because of preamble of COPYING _ even though
it states explicitly NOT to be part of the licence.

As of 5.15.0-3, build like the prior maxima-nox package:
Separate out the xmaxima package, built against the system's Tcl/Tk,
as a SplitOff.

Move mgnuplot into the xmaxima package as of version 5.21.x, since it uses the
wish as set from configure.

Previous versions maintained by William McCallum, Matthias Neeracher, and 
Andrea Riciputi.
<< 
DescDetail: << 
Maxima is a symbolic computation program. It is full featured, including
symbolic manipulation of polynomials, matrices, rational functions,
integration, Todd-coxeter, 2D and 3D plotting, an ODE solver, and bigfloats.
It contains a symbolic source level debugger for maxima code.
Maxima is based on the original MACsyma developed at MIT in the 1970's.
This package contains the command-line executables, demos, sources,
etc.
<<
DescUsage: <<
Enter "rmaxima" for a command line interface with line editing.  
The "maxima" executable doesn't have this capability now.
"xmaxima" has moved to its own packages.
X11 plotting in gnuplot can be turned on via flags sent to the plot commands.

Note:  if you rebuild sbcl-%type_pkg[sbcl]-maxima, you will probably see an 
error like:

fatal error encountered in SBCL pid 27474(tid 140735192965504):
can't load .core for different runtime, sorry

when attempting to run maxima.  Rebuilding maxima should fix this.
<<
DescPort: <<
IMPORTANT: Maxima will only reliably work with the version (and
revision) of the LISP that was used to build it.  As of maxima-5.23.2-3, we
have introduced a special 'sbcl-N-maxima' package, where N maps to the version
of SBCL (e.g. sbcl-1047-maxima-1.0.47-1 for sbcl-1.0.47), and which installs in
a versioned private directory so that multiple versions can be installed 
concurrently.
