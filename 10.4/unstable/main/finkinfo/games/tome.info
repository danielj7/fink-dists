Description: Troubles of Middle Earth, curses-based RPG

DescDetail: <<
Angband is a roguelike dungeon exploration game based on JRR Tolkien's 
works. There are a lot of Angband variants because Angband's sources were 
cleaned up by a remarkable person, Ben Harrison, which meant that as more 
people could understand the code, more people made variants. ToME, expands 
upon the Middle-Earth influence and is based on Zangband 2.2.0. ToME now 
follows the Tolkien world more closely than any other variant!

DescPort: <<
tome should be running suid games, but I couldn't figure out why tome was 
dropping uid while writing to lib directories. Therefore I am temporarily 
making the lib directory world-writable until I can figure out what to do 
about this.
