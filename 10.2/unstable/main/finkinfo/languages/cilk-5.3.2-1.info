Description: C-based language for multithreaded parallel programming
DescDetail: <<
 Cilk is a language for multithreaded parallel programming based on ANSI
C. Cilk is designed for general-purpose parallel programming, but it is
especially effective for exploiting dynamic, highly asynchronous
parallelism, which can be difficult to write in data-parallel or
message-passing style. 
 Unlike many other multithreaded programming systems, Cilk is algorithmic, in
that the runtime system employs a scheduler that allows the performance
of programs to be estimated accurately based on abstract complexity
measures.
