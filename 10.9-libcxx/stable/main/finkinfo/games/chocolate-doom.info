Description: Doom port
DescDetail:<<
Almost all modern Doom source ports change the game in some way.
In some cases, this is to fix bugs. In others, it is to add new
features or even change the behavior of the game. Chocolate Doom
is different, in that the focus is on creating a maintained
version of Doom that looks, feels and behaves exactly like the
original DOS version of Doom.

Originally just a port of the Doom source code, the purpose of
the project has grown to include ports of Heretic, Hexen and
Strife, other commercial games that were based on the Doom
engine.

There are a number of reasons for having a port which behaves
like the DOS version:
* Just Doom. No more. No less.
* DOS is dead. The official Windows port has serious bugs.
Chocolate Doom is a more accurate port that runs correctly on
Windows and other operating systems.
* Demo compatibility. Chocolate Doom maintains demo
compatibility.
* Testing. A WAD will work on all ports
