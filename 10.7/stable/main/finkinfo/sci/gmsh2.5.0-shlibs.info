Description: 3D finite element mesh generator
DescDetail: <<
 Gmsh is an automatic 3D finite element mesh generator (primarily
 Delaunay) with build-in CAD and post-processing facilities. Its
 design goal is to provide a simple meshing tool for academic test
 cases with parametric input and up to date visualization
 capabilities.

 Gmsh is built around four modules: geometry, mesh, solver and
 post-processing. The specification of any input to these modules is
 done either interactively using the graphical user interface or in
 ASCII text files using Gmsh's own scripting language.
 
 See Gmsh's reference manual for a more thorough overview of Gmsh's 
 capabilities.

DescUsage: <<
This package contains a shared library.

DescPackaging: <<
	Oddly enough, clang complains about a void function with a return
	value :-) so we patch that.

	Create a versioned dylib so that the -shlibs can coexist--given the
	lack of compatibility_version, it's hard to say whether different
	%v will be ABI-comptible without inspection.
	
	As of Revision 3:  don't install in a private location anymore, 
	since that's a bit excessive for a new package with one library.

	Uses Veclib for BLAS.  It appears not to use Fink's ATLAS even when that's 
	installed, so no -atlas variant currently.
	
	There appears to be something awry in gmsh-2.5.0-source/contrib/gmm/gmm_interface.h .
	clang from Xcode 4.3 decided that there was an error, and by inspection there
	appears indeed to be one.  I implemented a patch which seemed to be correct in
	context.
	This file is currently still unchanged in upstream's SVN.
	
	No METIS or TETGEN support because of their license limitations.

	Newer png.h doesn't include zlib.h automatically.
