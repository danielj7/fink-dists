DescDetail: <<
  PYTHIA is a program for the generation of high-energy physics events,
  i.e. for the description of collisions at high energies between elementary
  particles such as e+, e-, p and pbar in various combinations. It contains
  theory and models for a number of physics aspects, including hard and soft
  interactions, parton distributions, initial- and final-state parton showers,
  multiple interactions, fragmentation and decay. It is largely based on
  original research, but also borrows many formulae and other knowledge from
  the literature.
