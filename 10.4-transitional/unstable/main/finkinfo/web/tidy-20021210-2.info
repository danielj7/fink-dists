Description: Utility to tidy up HTML code
DescDetail: <<
 When editing HTML it's easy to make mistakes. Wouldn't it be nice if there 
was a simple way to fix these mistakes automatically and tidy up sloppy 
editing into nicely layed out markup? Well now there is! Dave Raggett's HTML 
TIDY is a free utility for doing just that. It also works great on the 
atrociously hard to read markup generated by specialized HTML editors and 
conversion tools, and can help you identify where you need to pay further 
attention on making your pages more accessible to people with disabilities.
