Description: Design and analyze of subsonic airfoils
DescDetail: <<
  XFOIL is an interactive program for the design and analysis of subsonic 
  isolated  airfoils. 
  It consists of a collection of menu-driven routines which perform various 
  useful functions such as:
  
    -Viscous (or inviscid) analysis of an existing airfoil, allowing
      -forced or free transition
      -transitional separation bubbles
      -limited trailing edge separation
      -lift and drag predictions just beyond CLmax
      -Karman-Tsien compressibility correction
      -fixed or varying Reynolds and/or Mach numbers
  
    -Airfoil design and redesign by interactive modification of surface speed 
     distributions, in two methods:
      -Full-Inverse method, based on a complex-mapping formulation
      -Mixed-Inverse method, an extension of XFOIL's basic panel method
  
    -Airfoil redesign by interactive modification of geometric parameters such 
     as
      -max thickness and camber, highpoint position
      -LE radius, TE thickness
      -camber line via geometry specification
      -camber line via loading change specification
      -flap deflection
      -explicit contour geometry (via screen cursor)
  
    -Blending of airfoils
    -Writing and reading of airfoil coordinates and polar save files
    -Plotting of geometry, pressure distributions, and multiple polars
