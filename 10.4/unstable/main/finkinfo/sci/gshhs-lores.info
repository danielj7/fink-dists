Description: GSHHS shorelines, rivers, borders (low res)
DescDetail: <<
 This package provides three low-resolution versions of the GSHHS
 (Global Self-consistant Hierarchical High-resolution Shorelines)
 data base: coarse, low and intermediate resolution.
 GSHHS combines the World Vector Shoreline and World Data Base II
 products into a single quality-checked hierarchical data base at
 5 resolutions.

 Although these shorelines are distributed as part of the Generic Mapping
 Tools (GMT), they can be used stand-alone or with other applications
 that can read NetCDF files.
<<
DescPort: <<
 These standard coastlines are essential to the gmt package.
 High-resolution coastlines can be found in the gshhs-hires package.
