# DISCLAIMER: Max Horn is the sole maintainer of this package.
# Please DO NOT MAKE MODIFICATIONS without informing the maintainer.
# Preferably, send a patch to me instead of making changes yourself!
# If that is not possible due to extra urgency, at least send me a mail.
#
# Explanation: I am sick and tired of getting back to my packages and
# discovering that people have messed with it. I am then forced to
# retrace their steps, find out who, when and why did make a certain
# change etc. -- i.e. it makes my life as maintainer harder.
# Furthermore, as maintainer I am responsible for problems caused by my
# packages. But I am not willing to take responsibility for something I
# did not do. In particular, for changes that other people introduced
# behind my back, no matter how good and noble their intentions were. As
# such, I may see myself forced to drop responsibility for (and hence,
# maintainership of) the affected package.

Description: Perl extension to find regexp delimited strings
DescDetail: <<
DelimMatch allows you to match delimited substrings in a buffer.
The delimiters can be specified with any regular expression and
the start and end delimiters need not be the same.  If the
delimited text is properly nested, entire nested groups are
returned.

In addition, you may specify quoting and escaping characters that
contribute to the recognition of start and end delimiters.
