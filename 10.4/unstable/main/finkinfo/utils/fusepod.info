<<
DescUsage: <<
To mount your ipod type at the console:

		mkdir [mount_to]
        fusepod [mount_to]
	
If FUSEPod fails to find your iPod you can specify the iPod's mountpoint
through the environment variable IPOD_DIR. Note that the iPod must already be
mounted so that you can read it.

For example, say my iPod is mounted at /Volumes/IPOD and I want to mount the
FUSEPod layer at /Users/keegan/ipod
You would enter at the console:
	
        IPOD_DIR="/Volumes/IPOD" fusepod /Users/keegan/ipod

You can also create the necessary files and directories for your iPod to
work. FUSEPod will prompt you if you specify IPOD_DIR which does not have
the necessary structure.
	
To unmount FUSEPod type at the console:

        umount [mounted_to]

To add songs copy them too

        [mounted_to]/Transfer

Or add the absolute path of the song to the file

        [mounted_to]/add_songs

You can also add files and recursively add directories through

        [mounted_to]/add_files.sh [ files/directories ] ...

To sync the database and copy the files run

        [mounted_to]/sync_ipod.sh [ -watch ]

The switch -watch will give you status messages while syncing the iPod.

For example, say I was in the [mounted_to] directory. To add a CD to my iPod I
would type at the command line:

        find /music/Deftones\ -\ BSides\ and\ Rarities > add_songs

Then if I also wanted to add another CD I would type at the command line:

        find /music/Darkest\ Hour\ -\ Undoing\ Ruin >> add_songs

or I could enter at the command line (this is should be in one line)

        ./add_files.sh /music/Deftones\ -\ BSides\ and\ Rarities \ 
                       /music/Darkest\ Hour\ -\ Undoing\ Ruin

or I could copy files over with cp or a filemanager (Konqueror, Nautilus...)
into the Transfer directory.

You can the view all the songs that will be added to the iPod by looking
in the Transfer directory and by running the command (Note songs that can't be
added will be ignored):

        less add_songs

If you are happy with the contents of add_songs and the Transfer directory you
can run the command:

        ./sync_ipod.sh
