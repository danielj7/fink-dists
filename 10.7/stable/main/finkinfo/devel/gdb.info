Description: The GNU Project Debugger
DescDetail: <<
GDB, the GNU Project debugger, allows you to see what is going on
`inside' another program while it executes -- or what another program
was doing at the moment it crashed.

DescPort: <<
Add http://sourceware.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/src/gdb/darwin-nat.c.diff?cvsroot=src&r1=1.31&r2=1.32
as backport from gdb trunk to fix i386 build. Also added the required --enable-64-bit-bfd to
configure for the i386 build so it can also work with x86_64 binaries.

gdb 7.7.1 compatible with gcc-fsf-4.8 and clang-3.4 but not gcc-fsf-4.9.
On 10.9, fails to debug with "dsym file UUID doesn't match" warnings.
<<
DescUsage: <<
The programs in this package are prefixed with fsf- (gdb is "fsf-gdb",
etc.) to avoid conflicting with Xcode's programs of the same name.

To execute fsf-gdb without using sudo, the binary needs to be codesigned
on each machine that it is installed on. This requires the creation
of a certificate and signing of the fsf-gdb binary with the following
steps.

1) Open the application 'Keychain Access' from the Utilities folder.
2) In the Keychain Access application, select the 'Create a
   Certificate...' submenu item from the 'Keychain Access' menu and
   the 'Certificate Assistant' submenu.
3) In the 'Certificate Assistant' panel, enter 'gdb-cert' for the name 
   of the certificate and leave the Identity Type as 'Self Signed Root'.
   Set the Certificate Type to 'Code Signing' and enable the 'Let me
   override defaults' checkbox. Click the 'Continue'  button. You may
   wish to lengthen the default 365 day lifespan of the certificate
   to 3650 days.
4) Continue clicking the 'Continue' buttons that appear until you see
   the panel to 'Specify a Location For The Certificate'. Set the
   Keychain to 'System' at this point. If you can't store the
   certificate in the 'System' keychain, create it in the 'login'
   keychain, then export it. You can then import it into the 'System'
   keychain.
5) Select the 'System' entry in the Keychains listing of the Keychain
   Access window. Select your newly created 'gdb-cert' certificate and
   select the 'Get Info' contextual menu item, expand the 'Trust'
   item and set 'Code Signing' to '"Always Trust'.
6) Quit the 'Keychain Access' application.
7) On darwin12 or later, you must edit the line in the file
   /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.taskgated.plist from

                   <string>-s</string>

   to

                   <string>-sp</string>

   adding the '-p' option. Due to kernel caching, a restart is needed
   for the changes to take effect.
8) After the restart, the actual codesigning should be done with the
   command 'sudo codesign -s gdb-cert %p/bin/fsf-gdb'. Note it can take
   over five minutes for the codesigning to complete.
