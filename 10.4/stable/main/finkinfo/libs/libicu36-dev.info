DescDetail: <<
The International Components for Unicode (ICU) libraries provide robust
and full-featured Unicode services on a wide variety of platforms.  ICU
supports the most current version of the Unicode standard, and they
provide support for supplementary Unicode characters (needed for GB
18030 repertoire support).

As computing environments become more heterogeneous, software
portability becomes more important. ICU lets you produce the same
results across all the various platforms you support, without
sacrificing performance.  It offers great flexibility to extend and
customize the supplied services, which include:

* Text: Unicode text handling, full character properties and character
  set conversions (500+ codepages)
* Analysis: Unicode regular expressions; full Unicode sets; character,
  word and line boundaries
* Comparison: Language sensitive collation and searching
* Transformations: normalization, upper/lowercase, script
  transliterations (50+ pairs)
* Locales: Comprehensive locale data (230+) and resource bundle
  architecture
* Complex Text Layout: Arabic, Hebrew, Indic and Thai
* Time: Multi-calendar and time zone
* Formatting and Parsing: dates, times, numbers, currencies, messages
  and rule based

Please note that this package is based on the ICU source provided by
Apple, as the CoreFoundation kit contains the IBM libICU implementation.
