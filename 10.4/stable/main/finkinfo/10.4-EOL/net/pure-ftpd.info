# DISCLAIMER: Max Horn is the sole maintainer of this package.
# Please DO NOT MAKE MODIFICATIONS without informing the maintainer.
# Preferably, send a patch to me instead of making changes yourself!
# If that is not possible due to extra urgency, at least send me a mail.
#
# Explanation: I am sick and tired of getting back to my packages and
# discovering that people have messed with it. I am then forced to
# retrace their steps, find out who, when and why did make a certain
# change etc. -- i.e. it makes my life as maintainer harder.
# Furthermore, as maintainer I am responsible for problems caused by my
# packages. But I am not willing to take responsibility for something I
# did not do. In particular, for changes that other people introduced
# behind my back, no matter how good and noble their intentions were. As
# such, I may see myself forced to drop responsibility for (and hence,
# maintainership of) the affected package.

Description: Efficient, lightweight, and secure ftp server
DescDetail: <<
Pure FTP Server is a fast, production quality, standards-conformant FTP
server based on Troll-FTPd. It has no known buffer overflows, is trivial
to set up, and is especially designed for modern kernels. Features include
PAM support, IPv6, chroot()ed home directories, virtual domains, built-in
'ls', FXP protocol, anti-warez system, bandwidth throttling, bounded ports
for passive downloads, an LDAP backend, XML output, and more.

<pidfile>%p/var/run/pure-ftpd.pid</pidfile>
</daemon>

</service>

DescUsage: <<
To configure pure-ftpd you can run it manually with '%p/sbin/pureftpd &'
as root with a number of command line  options. You can also set it up to
run as a daemon by running 'sudo daemonic enable pure-ftpd' and disable it
with 'sudo daemonic disable pure-ftpd'.

Alternatively, you can modify the xinetd settings for FTP to use pure-ftpd
instead of Apple's ftpd by editing /etc/xinetd.d/ftp appropriately. This way,
when you enabled FTP in the System Preferences, it will be used automatically.
