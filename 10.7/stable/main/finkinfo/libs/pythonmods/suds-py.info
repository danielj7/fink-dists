Description: Lightweight SOAP client for Python
DescDetail: <<
 The suds project is a Python soap web services client lib. Suds
 leverages Python meta programming to provide an intuitive API for
 consuming web services. Objectification of types defined in the WSDL
 is provided without class generation. Programmers rarely need to read
 the WSDL since services and WSDL based objects can be easily
 inspected. Supports pluggable soap bindings.
