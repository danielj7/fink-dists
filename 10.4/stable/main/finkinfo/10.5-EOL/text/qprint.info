DescDetail: <<
qprint is a command line utility which encodes and decodes files in RFC
1521 format.  It can be used within a pipeline as an encoding or decoding
filter, and is most commonly used in this manner as part of an automated
mail processing system.  With appropriate options, qprint can encode pure
binary files, but it's a poor choice since it may inflate the size of the
file by as much as a factor of three.  The base64 MIME encoding is a
better choice for such data.
