From the SIM Voleon web page:

SIM Voleon is a software development system for aiding in writing 3D
graphics application containing so-called "volumetric data", as is
often used in applications targeted at analysis tasks within the oil &
gas industry (e.g. from seismic measurements), in medical imaging (for
data generated by e.g. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, Computer
Tomography, or ultrasound equipment), and for many other purposes.

SIM Voleon is an add-on library to Systems in Motion's visualization
platform technology, known as "Coin". Coin is a high-level 3D graphics
library with a C++ Application Programming Interface. Its target
audience is developers of 3D graphics applications worldwide.

The library has the following major features:


It is fully portable over the full range of platforms also supported
by the Coin library, including all versions of Microsoft Windows, Mac
OS X, Linux, Sun Solaris, SGI IRIX, and most other UNIX variants.

Integrates smoothly with traditional polygonal 3D data visualization
from the Coin library, in a manner which is effortless for the
application programmer.

Provides interaction possibilities for direct queries in the 3D scene
on the volumetric data through picking support.

Volumes are visualized by using functionality which is assisted by
dedicated 3D hardware on most modern graphics cards, namely 2D texture
mapping.

Higher quality and better performance visualization is automatically
done on graphics card which supports hardware assisted 3D texture
mapping.

Color transfer functions can be manipulated in realtime using the
EXT_paletted_texture or the ARB_fragment_program OpenGL extension.

Maximum Intensity Projection and Sum Intensity Projection is supported
through hardware if available.

To use this library, the developer needs SoQt, SoXt, or SoGtk, but
there is no explicit dependency for in fink.

Will not build if fileutils is installed.
