Package: sqlite3
Version: 3.7.3
Revision: 1

Description: Embedded SQL database, version 3
DescDetail: <<
SQLite is a C library that implements an embeddable SQL database engine.
Programs that link with the SQLite library can have SQL database access
without running a separate RDBMS process. The distribution comes with a
standalone command-line access program ( sqlite ) that can be used to
administer an SQLite database and which serves as an example of how to
use the SQLite library.
<<
DescPort: <<
	Drop the sqlite3-tcl and -analyzer packages since nothing uses them.
	This lets us drop the tcl deps. Also use system's editline instead
	of readline5 which drops the readline5 and libncurses5 deps.
	
	Initial port by Pepe Barbe <pepe.barbe@gmail.com>
