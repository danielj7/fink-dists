 Description: Generic "python" command that invokes python26
<<
DocFiles: README LICENSE 
Description: Interpreted, object-oriented language
DescDetail: <<
 Python is often compared to Tcl, Perl, Scheme or Java. 
 This package installs unix python - not the OSX Framework version.
 Builds a two-level namespace dynamic libpython (needed for koffice).

 The interpretter is installed as "python2.6", and all associated
 commands are similarly named with the python-version in them. To get
 the simple "python" command, install the fink package "python" (note:
 the "python" command there is not guaranteed to be python2.6!).
<<
DescUsage: <<
	python2.6 changes the compiler options used to compile
	third-party python modules. Please do not add 2.6 variants
	to them without actually testing that they build cleanly.
<<

DescPackaging: <<
	Patch a lot of things to impliment shared-lib support for
	non-Framework build on Darwin.

	Static libpython is installed in lib/pythonX.X/config/ but
	shared goes in %p/lib by default. Fink's packaging has always
	placed manually-built shared lib in config/ along side static,
	This gives consistency regardless of -search_paths_first.
	Continue this practice so that -pyXX varianted packages don't
	need special-casing for certain variants.

	Make sure all compiled modules link against libpython2.6 (and
	propagate this to third-party compiled modules) to ensure that
	all symbols resolved at compile-time to avoid packager
	mistakes and user runtime surprises.

	Should use --with-pth (fink's pth package)?

	Play lots of games to make sure we get expected support
	libraries. Also make sure -L/sw/lib/system-openssl is passed
	before -L/sw (build system seems to confuse standard meanings
	and uses of CFLAGS vs CPPFLAGS vs LDFLAGS) but avoid
	propagating into modules that compile using distutils.

	Adjust "python" unversioned link to be a symlink not a hard link.

	Must remain Epoch'ed so that this "python" pkg to be newer
	than the one from lower %v pkgs.

	Shared lib is buried next to static one instead of being in
	%p/lib because that's where it's always been in the fink
	package series. Why would they be in different places? Patch
	-config script to continue this tradition (bug in previous
	versions accidentally did the Right Thing here).

	Cannot use higher than db47
