cdf and posd:

posd is an osascript embedded in a shell script that returns the pwd
corresponding to the frontmost finder window.  Its real value is when
aliased to the command cdf, i.e., cdf='cd "$(/sw/bin/posd)"'.  The command
cdf changes the terminal pwd to match that of the frontmost finder window.

fdc: 

fdc is essentially the reciprocal operation of cdf.  It changes the finder 
window to match the pwd of the terminal in which the command is issued.

Extras:

A disk image containing Finder toolbar applications is placed into 
/sw/share/pos

A further powerful use of posd is in conjunction with a posd.term file that is
created from saving an open terminal session after setting all defaults to the
prefered state.  Then change the lines in the new posd.term

     <key>ExecutionString</key> 
     <string></string> 

to the following for a tcsh terminal session:

    <key>ExecutionString</key> 
    <string>cd "`/sw/bin/posd`"; pwd </string> 

or to the following for a zsh or bash session:

    <key>ExecutionString</key>
    <string>cd "$(/sw/bin/posd)";pwd</string>

and the resulting file is a clickable icon that can be placed in the finder 
tool bar.  Clicking opens a new terminal window corresponding to the finder.

Applescript versions of this having greater functionality for both 
Terminal.app and iTerm.app are placed in /sw/share/pos

Some of these Applescripts require that System Preferences > Universal Access 
> Enable Access for Assistive Devices be turned on to run and compile the 
programs.  In addition, Applescript UI scripting, available here, 
http://www.apple.com/applescript/GUI/ , must be installed to compile 
these Applescripts.
