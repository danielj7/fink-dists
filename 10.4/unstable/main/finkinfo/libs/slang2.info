# DISCLAIMER: Max Horn is the sole maintainer of this package.
# Please DO NOT MAKE MODIFICATIONS without informing the maintainer.
# Preferably, send a patch to me instead of making changes yourself!
# If that is not possible due to extra urgency, at least send me a mail.
#
# Explanation: I am sick and tired of getting back to my packages and
# discovering that people have messed with it. I am then forced to
# retrace their steps, find out who, when and why did make a certain
# change etc. -- i.e. it makes my life as maintainer harder.
# Furthermore, as maintainer I am responsible for problems caused by my
# packages. But I am not willing to take responsibility for something I
# did not do. In particular, for changes that other people introduced
# behind my back, no matter how good and noble their intentions were. As
# such, I may see myself forced to drop responsibility for (and hence,
# maintainership of) the affected package.

Description: S-Lang programming library
DescDetail: <<
S-Lang is an interpreted language that was designed from the start to
be easily embedded into a program to provide it with a powerful
extension language.

S-Lang also provides a platform-independent interface for screen
management, keymaps and low-level terminal I/O.
