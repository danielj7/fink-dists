Description: Text screen based source browsing tool
DescDetail: <<
Cscope is a text screen based source browsing tool.  Although it is
primarily designed to search C code (including lex and yacc files), it
can also be used for C++ code.  Using cscope, you can easily search for
where symbols are used and defined.
<<
DescPort: <<
  dmacks disabled autodetection of tools that aren't used for anything
  and switched to using system's memset() if it is available.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
  flex lib is static-only so no need for runtime dep on it.
