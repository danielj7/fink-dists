DescDetail: <<
  TIDY v7.2 is a highly configurable FORTRAN program to indent and renumber
  statements, selectively change case of keywords or non-keywords, and do
  various other clean-up tasks on FORTRAN-77 source programs.  TIDY can
  convert some FORTRAN-66 features such as Hollerith constants to
  FORTRAN-77.  TIDY can either retain DO/END DO loops or convert them to
  standard FORTRAN-77 loops.  It can change comment specifiers from C, c,
  or * to ! as in F90 style.  Supports F90 CYCLE, EXIT, DO WHILE loops,
  IMPLICIT NONE, INCLUDE statements, long variable names, relational
  operators in symbolic form such as == and /=, and the use of underscores
  in variable names.
