DescUsage: <<
	flag-sort [-v] CMD ARG1 ARG2 ...

The command CMD is launched with ARG1 ARG2 ... as arguments. The
arguments are re-ordered to put compiler search-path flags (-I and -L)
in an order appropriate for fink. The paths are sorted in the
following order:
	anything un-recognized
	local/relative (full paths that are local aren't noticed here) 
	fink %p
	x11 (and /usr/X11 before /usr/X11R6)
	system (/usr)
	/usr/local
Within each catagory, order is maintained as given.

The -v flag causes flag-sort to print the command that will be
launched and all the flags in order on STDOUT.
