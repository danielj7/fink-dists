Description: Powerful network protocol analyzer (with SSL)
DescDetail: <<
Wireshark is a free network protocol analyzer for Unix and Windows.
It allows you to examine data from a live network or from a capture
file on disk. You can interactively browse the capture data, viewing
summary and detail information for each packet. Wireshark has several
powerful features, including a rich display filter language and the
ability to view the reconstructed stream of a TCP session.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
Although this package has a GPL license, it is marked Restrictive since
it links to openssl.

Might eventually link against and depend on the adns and lua packages.
Since adns and lua are not in stable, I am not (yet) doing this.
