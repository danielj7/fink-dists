# Additional Info:
DescDetail: <<
Text::Autoformat provides intelligent formatting of
plaintext without the need for any kind of embedded mark-up. The module
recognizes Internet quoting conventions, a wide range of bulleting and
number schemes, centred text, and block quotations, and reformats each
appropriately. Other options allow the user to adjust inter-word
and inter-paragraph spacing, justify text, and impose various
capitalization schemes. 

The module also supplies a re-entrant, highly configurable replacement
for the built-in Perl format() mechanism.

	Changes entries.

	dmacks--"version" doesn't appear to be used anywhere in
	build/test or actual module; nuke its build-time dependency to
	avoid our having to be perlversioned for a version-pmXXX dep
