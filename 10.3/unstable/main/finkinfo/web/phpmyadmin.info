Description: Web interface to MySQL
DescDetail: <<
 phpMyAdmin is a tool written in PHP intended to handle the
 administration of MySQL over the WWW. Currently it can create and drop
 databases, create/drop/alter tables, delete/edit/add fields, execute
 any SQL statement, manage keys on fields. 
<<
DescUsage: <<
 To use phpmyadmin you MUST configure the file 
/sw/share/phpmyadmin/config.inc.php.
 The settings host, auth_type, user, password, and PmaAbsoluteUri are required.
 See the file /sw/share/doc/phpmyadmin/Documentation.html for details.
 When upgrading, use apt's ConfFiles "diff" mode to see what (if anything) has 
changed.
 To access the interface, open the directory /sw/share/phpmyadmin in your 
browser.
 You must have php enabled in your apache conf file. 
 You may wish to add a symlink to there like so:
 ln -s /sw/share/phpmyadmin /Library/WebServer/Documents/phpmyadmin
 
 If you do not have a remote MySQL server, you should install the "mysql" 
package 
 as well as the client.
