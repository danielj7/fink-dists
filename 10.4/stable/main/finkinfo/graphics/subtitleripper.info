Description: DVD subtitle extractor
DescDetail: <<
This package extracts DVD subtitles from a subtitle stream and
converts it to pgm or ppm images or into VobSub format.  The main
purpose is to provide the required input to OCR software to convert
the subtitle images into ASCII text. Please note that the conversion
into ASCII is not part of this package but requires an OCR program
like gocr.

Besides programs to convert DVD subtitles to images (subtitle2pgm)
or VobSub files (subtitle2vobsub), and to convert VobSub files to
images (vobsub2pgm), this package provides a help script to call gocr
on the images (pgm2txt), as well as a tool to do common manipulations
(such as renumberings or time adjustments) on textual subtitles in
the resulting subrip format (srttool).
<<

DescPort: <<
The system sed does not understand the syntax used by the pgm2txt script.
