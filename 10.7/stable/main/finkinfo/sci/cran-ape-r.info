DescDetail: <<
ape provides functions for reading, writing, plotting, and manipulating
phylogenetic trees, analyses of comparative data in a phylogenetic
framework, ancestral character analyses, analyses of diversification
and macroevolution, computing distances from allelic and nucleotide data,
reading and writing nucleotide sequences, and several tools such as
Mantel's test, generalized skyline plots, graphical exploration of
phylogenetic data (alex, trex, kronoviz), estimation of absolute
evolutionary rates and clock-like trees using mean path lengths and
penalized likelihood. Phylogeny estimation can be done with the NJ,
BIONJ, ME, MVR, SDM, and triangle methods, and several methods
handling incomplete distance matrices (NJ*, BIONJ*, MVR*, and the
corresponding triangle method). Some functions call external 
applications (PhyML, Clustal, T-Coffee, Muscle) whose results are
returned into R.
