Description: Minimal interface to Readline
DescDetail: <<
  This is a quick implementation of the minimal interface to Readline
  libraries. The implementation is made in Perl (mostly) by Jeffrey
  Friedl. The only thing this library does is to make it conformant (and
  add some minimal changes, like using Term::ReadKey if present, and
  correct work under xterm). 

  (In fact this is an understatement now, a lot of additions are made,
  see CHANGES...)
<<
DescPort: <<
  make test disabled, user interaction in tests.
