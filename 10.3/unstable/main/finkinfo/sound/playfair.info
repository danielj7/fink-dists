Description: Remove "FairPlay" DRM from AAC files
DescDetail: <<
When Apple opened the iTunes Music Store, they licensed a technology
called "FairPlay" from a company called "Veridisc".  FairPlay is a
Digital Rights Management (DRM) system that limits a users rights on a
digital media file that they've purchased and presumably downloaded.
In the case of Apple's iTunes Music Store, when a user downloads an
audio track from iTMS, it is a "Protected AAC Audio File".  When used
as intended, these files can only be played through the iTunes program
itself.  Furthermore, a particular computer must first be "authorized"
to play the given file.  FairPlay allows up to three computers and
unlimited Apple iPods to be authorized to play the file.  As DRM
schemes go, FairPlay is only moderately offensive.

So what will playfair do for you? The playfair program is quite
simple.  It takes one of the iTMS Protected AAC Audio Files, decodes
it using a key obtained from your iPod or Microsoft Windows system
and then writes the new, decoded version to disk as a regular AAC
Audio File.  It then optionally copies the metadata tags that
describe the song, including the cover art, to the new file.

Note that while the playfair source code is GPL, I've marked the
licensing as "Restrictive", not only because of questions as to
the patent issues involved in the code in this package, but because
one of the libraries used for decoding (mp4v2) is under the Mozilla
Public License, and it's not clear how they interact.

I'll get more info on the licensing and decide later whether to
change this, but for now, you'll have to build it yourself.  =)

It appears that the argument parsing of this is a bit buggy, run
"playfair -h" for options.
