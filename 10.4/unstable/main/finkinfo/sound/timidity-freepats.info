DescDetail: <<
This package provides a set of patches for the timidity.

Freepats is a project to create a free and open set of instrument
patches, in any format, that can be used with softsynths. Please use
the Wiki for notes and documentation.

We would like to collect and host samples and instrument patches in
any format so if you are interested in contributing to the project
then send a message to freepats at opensrc dot org and ask for a FTP
login account. Needless to say, any uploaded content must either be in
the Public Domain or have an open and free redistribution license.
