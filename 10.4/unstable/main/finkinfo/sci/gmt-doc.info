Description: Generic Mapping Tools (Documents)
DescDetail: <<
 Documents and examples for GMT.

 GMT is an open source collection of ~60 tools for manipulating
 geographic and Cartesian data sets (including filtering, trend
 fitting, gridding, projecting, etc.) and producing Encapsulated
 PostScript File (EPS) illustrations ranging from simple x-y plots
 via contour maps to artificially illuminated surfaces and 3-D
 perspective views. GMT supports ~30 map projections and transformations
 and comes with support data such as coastlines, rivers, and political
 boundaries.

DescPort: <<
 Combined the Cookbook and Tuturial documentation with the scripts
 that they refer to. Put them all in %p/share/doc/gmt.
 Removed one file that should not have been in the scripts package.
