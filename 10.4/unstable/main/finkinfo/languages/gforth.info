Description: Fast and portable ANS Forth
DescDetail: <<
Gforth is a fast and portable implementation of the ANS Forth
language. It works nicely with the Emacs editor, offers some nice
features such as input completion and history and a powerful locals
facility, and it even has (the beginnings of) a manual. Gforth employs
traditional implementation techniques: its inner interpreter is
indirect or direct threaded.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
Had to add a dummy emacs directory because the makefile checks its existence.
Patched engine/Makefile to acknowledge CPPFLAGS.
Disabled vmgen installation.
<<
DescPort: <<
Removed ac_cv_sizeof_longlong override for ppc in configure
