Description: FUSE ssh filesystem
DescDetail: <<
This is a filesystem client based on the SSH File Transfer
Protocol. Since most SSH servers already support this protocol it is
very easy to set up: i.e. on the server side there's nothing to do.
On the client side mounting the filesystem is as easy as logging into
the server with ssh: "sshfs host: mountpoint"
<<
DescUsage: <<
Invoking sshfs with the options
-oreconnect,kill_on_unmount,volname="finder volume name"
will probably improve its interaction with the Finder.
