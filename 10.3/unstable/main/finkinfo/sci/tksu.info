Description: TclTk GUI for CWP-SU (Seismic Unix)
DescDetail: <<
Tksu is a graphical front end to the SU seismic processing package.
It provides dialogs for setting module parameters, online help, and
the ability to build a processing flow from arbitrarily connected
modules.  It creates a shell script which may be run interactively or
exported for running later.

Although designed with SU in mind, Tksu is an independent application.
Since it interfaces with SU via shell scripts, it can manage any
module that implements the SU command line protocol.
<<
DescPort: <<
Skip using the INSTALL script.  It just gets in the way.

Do NOT install xless... it will conflict with xless.info.  In the
future, I need to figure out exactly how the utility.spec file works
so I can rename xless to something that will not conflict.
