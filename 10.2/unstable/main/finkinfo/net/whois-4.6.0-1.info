Description: Improved Whois client
DescDetail: <<
This is an improved Whois client that follows the delegations
from the Verisign main whois server.  It looks at the returned
"Whois Server:" line (if any) and queries the specified server.
<<
DescPort: <<
Enabled gettext support by defining -DENABLE_NLS and -DLOCALEDIR
during compile as config.h does not have a setting for __APPLE__ yet.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
Patched the Makefiles to put the man page and locale files in 
the proper Fink directories. Patched path in man file.
