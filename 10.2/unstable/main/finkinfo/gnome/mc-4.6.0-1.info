Description: Midnight Commander File Manager
DescDetail: <<
The Midnight Commander is the file manager of GNOME 1.2. It is
responsible for putting icons on the desktop background.

There is also a terminal interface that runs inside a terminal
emulator. It is radically different from the GNOME interface and
modeled after the famous Norton Commander file manager.
<<
DescPort: <<
The Makefiles don't care much about the order of flags and the like,
so we use some tricks to get it right.

Previous versions by Christoph Pfisterer.
<<
DescUsage: <<
If the function keys don't work in the terminal version, try the
sequence Esc-<number>, e.g. Esc-0 for F10.
