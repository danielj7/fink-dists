Description: Calculates and draws geodesic domes
DescDetail: <<
DOME is a program which calculates the properties of a geodesic dome
symmetry triangle. DOME calculates spherical vertex coordinates,
symmetry triangle topological abundance, and chord factors. DOME
supports class I (alternate) and class II (triacon) breakdowns for
Icosahedron, Octahedron and Tetrahedron polyhedron types. DOME also
supports "Buckyball" formations as well as elliptical geodesics &
geodesic parabolic dishes.
