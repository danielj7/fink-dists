Description: Reads the repository via its ViewCVS web interface
DescDetail: <<
CVSGrab is another kind of CVS client. When other CVS clients use the cvs
protocol or ssh to read the repository, this utility reads the repository
via its ViewCVS web interface.

The advantage is that if you are behind a firewall that prevents you from
updating files from a remote CVS server, this program will be able to bypass
the firewall and download the latest files from the repository.

Disadvantages are that you have only read access to the repository, the
repository needs to be public and have ViewCVS set up.

It is recommended that you only use CVSGrab if you are prohibited from using
a normal CVS client, e.g. if you are behind a firewall with strict access
rules.  CVSGrab is  much slower than normal CVS, and adds more load to the
server.
