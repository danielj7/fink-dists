The report gives a defining description of the programming language
Scheme. Scheme is a statically scoped and properly tail-recursive
dialect of the Lisp programming language invented by Guy Lewis Steele
Jr. and Gerald Jay Sussman. It was designed to have an exceptionally
clear and simple semantics and few different ways to form
expressions. A wide variety of programming paradigms, including
functional, imperative, and message passing styles, find convenient
expression in Scheme.
