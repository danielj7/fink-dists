Description: Scalable PostScript Fonts for MetaFont
DescDetail: <<
mftrace is a small Python program that lets you trace a TeX bitmap 
font into a PFA or PFB font (A PostScript Type1 Scalable Font) or 
TTF (TrueType) font. 

Scalable fonts offer many advantages over bitmaps, as they allow 
documents to render correctly at many printer resolutions. 
Moreover, Ghostscript can generate much better PDF, if given 
scalable PostScript fonts.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
Although mftrace could work with autotrace instead of potrace, 
the latter is much faster, so we go with potrace.
