DescDetail: <<
Functions that solve initial value problems of a system of first-order
ordinary differential equations (ODE), of partial differential equations
(PDE), of differential algebraic equations (DAE), and of delay differential
equations. The functions provide an interface to the FORTRAN functions lsoda,
lsodar, lsode, lsodes of the ODEPACK collection, to the FORTRAN functions
dvode and daspk and a C-implementation of solvers of the Runge-Kutta family
with fixed or variable time steps. The package contains routines designed
for solving ODEs resulting from 1-D, 2-D and 3-D partial differential
equations (PDE) that have been converted to ODEs by numerical differencing.
