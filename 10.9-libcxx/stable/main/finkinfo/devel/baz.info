DescDetail: <<
Baz is a deprecated implementation of the GNU Arch protocol in C,
based on tla. It focuses on making tla's UI more accessible, but
also has smarter merging and gettext support.

GNU Arch is a revision control system with features that are ideal
for projects characterised by widely distributed development,
concurrent support of multiple releases, and substantial amounts
of development on branches. It can be a replacement for CVS and
corrects many mis-features of that system.
