Description: Utility like ping, for measuring http response
DescDetail: <<
  Httping is like 'ping' but for http-requests.
  Give it an url, and it'll show you how long it takes to connect,
  send a request and retrieve the reply (only the headers). Be aware
  that the transmission across the network also takes time!
