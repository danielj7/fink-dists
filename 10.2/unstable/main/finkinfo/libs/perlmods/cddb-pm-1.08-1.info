Description: High-level interface to cddb protocol servers
DescDetail: <<
This module provides a high-level Perl interface to cddbp servers. With it, a Perl program can identify and possibly gather details about a CD based on its "table of contents" (the disc's track times and offsets).
Disc details have been useful for generating CD catalogs, naming mp3 files, printing CD liners, or even just playing discs in an automated jukebox
