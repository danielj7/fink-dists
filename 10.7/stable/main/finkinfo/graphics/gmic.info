DescDetail: <<
 G'MIC is focused on the design of possibly complex pipelines for converting,
 manipulating, filtering and visualizing generic 1d/2d/3d multi-spectral image
 datasets. This includes of course color images, but also more complex data
 as image sequences or 3d(+t) volumetric float-valued datasets.

 G'MIC is an open framework : the default language can be extended with
 custom G'MIC-written commands, defining thus new image available filters or
 effects. By the way, it already contains a substantial set of pre-defined
 image processing algorithms and pipelines (more than 1000).

 Includes these two binary tools:
   - The command-line executable 'gmic' to use the G'MIC framework from a
     shell.
   - The interactive and extensible plug-in 'gmic_gimp' to bring G'MIC
     capabilities to the image retouching software GIMP.
   - The ZArt real-time interface for webcams is currently not included in 
     the Fink package.

DescPort: <<
o Be consistent in the use of $prefix to avoid installing outside %p

o The OpenCV parts of zart were created for an older version, and OpenCV
  changed their library names after 2.2, so make sure we use current names
<<
DescUsage: <<
This package installs a command line utility and Gimp-2.0 plugin.
