Description: Generate SQL from Perl data structures
DescDetail: <<
  This module was inspired by the excellent DBIx::Abstract. However, in
  using that module I found that what I really wanted to do was generate
  SQL, but still retain complete control over my statement handles and use
  the DBI interface. So, I set out to create an abstract SQL generation
  module.
