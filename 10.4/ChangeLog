	* inject.pl: (partially) revert to a simpler version of the script
	* inject.pl: If our VERSION has four parts (separated by decimal 
	points), then it is an update tarball and we require that the 
	distribution with a three-part VERSION (the first three parts of ours)
	has already been installed. This is tested using the stamp-rel-* files.

	* inject.pl: adapt the script so that, if passed the flag "-updates",
	it will correctly inject an -updates tarball
