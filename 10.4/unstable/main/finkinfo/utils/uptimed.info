Description: Utility to log computer uptimes
DescDetail: <<
An uptime record daemon keeping track of the highest uptimes a computer
system ever had. It uses the system boot time to keep sessions apart
from each other. Uptimed comes with a console front-end to parse the
records, which can also easily be used to show your records on a web 
page.
<<
DescUsage: <<
Run 'daemonic enable upclient' as root, this will install a Startup Item
                a) either reboot (easy :-) )
                b) or else, if this is a first time installation (or if you
		   know no instance of uptimed is running), run 
		   '/Library/StartupItems/daemonic-upclient/daemonic-uptimed
		   start' as root.

To stop keeping track of your uptimes, run 'daemonic disable upclient' 
as root. This will not kill a running instance at this time. Reboot the
machine to get rid of it, or run " kill `cat /sw/var/run/uptimed.pid` "
as root.
