Package: mizar
Depends: mizar-bin, mizar-mml, mizar-doc
Architecture: i386
Version: 7.9.03-4.104.1021
Revision: 1
Description: Build and check first-order formal proofs
Recommends: mizar-semantic-mml, mizar-gab, mizar-mode, mizar-gab-html
DescDetail: <<
The Mizar project started around 1973 as an attempt to reconstruct
mathematical vernacular in a computer-oriented environment.  Since
then a vast number of articles, representing formal developments of
various parts of mathematics, have been written.  Accompanying this
library of proofs is a verification system for checking the
correctness of a proof.

Installing this package will install the Mizar binaries (which are
used to check proofs for correctness), user documentation, and the MML
(Mizar Mathematical Library).

See the Mizar homepage, http://www.mizar.org, for more information.
The Mizar community maintains a wiki; it is available at
http://wiki.mizar.org .

Installing this package will install the Mizar binaries,
documentation, and the MML.
