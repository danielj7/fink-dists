Description: Program for transferring files using SSH
DescDetail: <<
zssh (Zmodem SSH) is a program that can transfer files to a remote machine using a SSH connection. It acts as an alternative to scp.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
Patch modifies install target to install files in correct directories.
InstallScript creates directories, which are not created during install target of zssh, and uses 'make install' command as the appended 'DESTDIR=%d' is not needed.
ConfigureParams places manpages in correct directory.
PatchScript moves INSTALL file to INSTALL.txt to avoid 'up to date' error when installing.
<<
DescPort: '-no-cpp-precomp' added to CPPFLAGS to compile properly.
