Description: Tool to create OpenNMS trap events
DescDetail: <<
OpenNMS has the ability to receive SNMP traps; In order to
do that, OpenNMS must know how to treat each event (thus
requires a description for each OID that it receives).

This tool reads a MIB file and creates a relevant OpenNMS
event xml file, which enables it to receive traps more
specifically.
