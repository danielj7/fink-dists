DescDetail: <<
JGraphT is a free Java graph library that provides mathematical graph-theory
objects and algorithms. JGraphT supports various types of graphs including:

* directed and undirected graphs.
* graphs with weighted / unweighted / labeled or any user-defined edges.
* various edge multiplicity options, including: simple-graphs, multigraphs,
  pseudographs.
* unmodifiable graphs - allow modules to provide "read-only" access to internal
  graphs.
* listenable graphs - allow external listeners to track modification events.
* subgraphs graphs that are auto-updating subgraph views on other graphs.
* all compositions of above graphs.

Although powerful, JGraphT is designed to be simple and type-safe (via Java 5
generics). For example, graph vertices can be of any objects. You can create
graphs based on: Strings, URLs, XML documents, etc; you can even create graphs
of graphs!
