Description: Manage your translation project

DescDetail: <<
Pootle is a user-friendly web portal that makes the translation process so much
simpler. It allows online translation, work asignement, gives statistics and
allows easy volunteer contribution. You can run Pootle as an Internet server
like these projects or run your own copy on an Intranet (for individual work,
team work or Transalte@thons).

Pootle makes use of the Translate Toolkit. Together, these tools are part of
the WordForge Project whose aim is to make translation easier and of higher
quality by creating better tools and user-friendly, central information.
