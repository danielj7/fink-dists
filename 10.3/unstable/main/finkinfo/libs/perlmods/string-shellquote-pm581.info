Description: Quotes strings to pass them successfully through the shell
DescDetail: <<
  String-ShellQuote quote strings so they can be passed through the shell.
  Each string is quoted so that the shell will pass it along as a
  single argument and without further interpretation.  If no strings
  are given an empty string is returned.
