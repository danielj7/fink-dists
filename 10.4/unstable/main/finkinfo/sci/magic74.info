DescDetail: <<
Magic is a venerable VLSI layout tool, written in the 1980's at Berkeley
by John Ousterhout, now famous primarily for writing the scripting interpreter
language Tcl. Due largely in part to its liberal Berkeley open-source license,
magic has remained popular with universities and small companies.

The open-source license has allowed VLSI engineers with a bent toward
programming to implement clever ideas and help magic stay abreast of
fabrication technology. However, it is the well thought-out core algorithms
which lend to magic the greatest part of its popularity. Magic is widely cited
as being the easiest tool to use for circuit layout, even for people who
ultimately rely on commercial tools for their product design flow.

DescPackaging: <<
Executables are not suffixed (yet).  
Left many files in default installed subdirs, even ones that go against
standard convention: e.g. arch-independent files are lib %p/lib/magic where 
really, they belong in %p/share/...
<<
DescPort: <<
Initial attempt to port by Fang.
BLT dependency added to support cell-manager widget (min version?).
