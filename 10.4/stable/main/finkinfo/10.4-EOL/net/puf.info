Description: Parallel URL Fetcher
DescDetail: << 
puf is a tool that can be used to download single files or mirror
entire servers. It is similar to GNU wget (and has a partly-compatible
command line), but has the ability to do many downloads in parallel.
This is very useful if you have a high-bandwidth Internet connection.
