DescDetail: <<
SampleICC provides an open source platform independent C++ library 
for reading, writing, manipulating, and applying ICC profiles along 
with applications that make use of this library. 
Some of the applications are platform independent, while others are 
built using Microsoft Visual Studio. A working knowledge of the ICC 
specification and color management workflows will aid in 
understanding the library and its proper usage. 
The latest ICC profile specification can be found on the ICC 
website (http://www.color.org). 
Several useful white papers and resources are also available on 
the website.
