# DISCLAIMER: Max Horn is the sole maintainer of this package.
# Please DO NOT MAKE MODIFICATIONS without informing the maintainer.
# Preferably, send a patch to me instead of making changes yourself!
# If that is not possible due to extra urgency, at least send me a mail.
#
# Explanation: I am sick and tired of getting back to my packages and
# discovering that people have messed with it. I am then forced to
# retrace their steps, find out who, when and why did make a certain
# change etc. -- i.e. it makes my life as maintainer harder.
# Furthermore, as maintainer I am responsible for problems caused by my
# packages. But I am not willing to take responsibility for something I
# did not do. In particular, for changes that other people introduced
# behind my back, no matter how good and noble their intentions were. As
# such, I may see myself forced to drop responsibility for (and hence,
# maintainership of) the affected package.

# Currently, there is no papi package in Fink. If we ever add one, we
# may want to use it here. Until then, explicitly disable papi support
# to avoid introducing a hidden dependency.
#
# We disable png to avoid a big dependency for an unclear gain.

Description: Fast arithmetic with dense F_2-matrices
DescDetail: <<
M4RI is a library for fast arithmetic with dense matrices over F_2. The name
M4RI comes from the first implemented algorithm: The "Method of the Four
Russians" inversion algorithm published by Gregory Bard. This algorithm in
turn is named after the "Method of the Four Russians" multiplication
algorithm which is probably better referred to as Kronrod's method.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
The ABI of this package is not stable. Disable shared libraries for now
to avoid having to set a new package name for each new version.
