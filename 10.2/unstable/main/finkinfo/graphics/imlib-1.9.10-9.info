Description: General image handling library for X11 and Gtk
DescDetail: <<
Imlib1 provides common image handling routines plus loaders for a
range of image formats. It's designed to be used with Xlib or with
Gtk.
<<
DescPort: <<
Uses autoconf and libtool. The usual fixes.

Needs a patch to build image loaders as modules, not shared libraries,
and to avoid duplicate symbol errors for x_error. Shared memory is
disabled because it doesn't work correctly on Darwin.

The static versions of the modules are deleted because they are not
used.
