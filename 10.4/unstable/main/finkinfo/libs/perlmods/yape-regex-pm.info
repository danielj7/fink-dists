Description: Yet Another Parser/Extractor for reg exps
DescDetail: <<
The YAPE hierarchy of modules is an attempt at a unified means of
parsing and extracting content. It attempts to maintain a generic
interface, to promote simplicity and reusability. The API is powerful,
yet simple. The modules do tokenization (which can be intercepted) and
build trees, so that extraction of specific nodes is doable.

This module is yet another (?) parser and tree-builder for Perl
regular expressions. It builds a tree out of a regex, but at the
moment, the extent of the extraction tool for the tree is quite
limited (see the section on "Extracting Sections"). However, the tree
can be useful to extension modules.
