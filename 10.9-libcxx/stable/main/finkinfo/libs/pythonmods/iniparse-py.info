Description: INI parser for Python
DescDetail: <<
Backward compatible implementations of ConfigParser, RawConfigParser,
and SafeConfigParser are included that are API-compatible with the
Python standard library. They pass all the unit tests included with
Python.

Order of sections & options, indentation, comments, and blank lines
are preserved as far as possible when data is updated.

Values can be accessed using dotted notation (cfg.user.name), or using
container syntax (cfg['user']['name']).

It is very useful for config files that are updated both by users and
by programs, since it is very disorienting for a user to have her
config file completely rearranged whenever a program changes
it. iniparse also allows making the order of entries in a config file
significant, which is desirable in applications like image galleries.
