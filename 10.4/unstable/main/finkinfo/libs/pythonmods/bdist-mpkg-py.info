Description: Build OS X installer packages from distutils
DescDetail: <<
This is a distutils plugin that implements the bdist_mpkg command,
which builds a Mac OS X metapackage for use by Installer.app for easy
GUI installation of Python modules, much like bdist_wininst.

It also comes with a bdist_mpkg script, which is a setup.py front-end
that will allow you to easy build an installer metapackage from nearly
any existing package that uses distutils.
