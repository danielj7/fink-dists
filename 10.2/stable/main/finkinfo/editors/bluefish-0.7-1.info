Description: Web-oriented text editor
DescDetail: <<
Bluefish is a syntax-coloring text editor for the experienced web
designer. It was designed for editing HTML, PHP and the like.
<<
DescPort: <<
Needs various patches, mostly fixing system header includes. The patch
disables the use of SysV IPC messages. INSTALL must be moved out of
the way because the Makefile doesn't declare the 'install' target as
phony. cap.c is patched because islower and isupper are implemented as
macros on Darwin so there is no function pointer to assign.
