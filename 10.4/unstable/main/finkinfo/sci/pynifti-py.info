  Beautiful Soup is a Python HTML/XML parser designed for quick
  turnaround projects like screen-scraping. Three features make
  it powerful:
  1. Beautiful Soup won't choke if you give it bad markup.
     It yields a parse tree that makes approximately as much
     sense as your original document. This is usually good enough
     to collect the data you need and run away.
  2. Beautiful Soup provides a few simple methods and Pythonic
     idioms for navigating, searching, and modifying a parse
     tree: a toolkit for dissecting a document and extracting
     what you need. You don't have to create a custom parser
     for each application.
  3. Beautiful Soup automatically converts incoming documents
     to Unicode and outgoing documents to UTF-8. You don't have
     to think about encodings, unless the document doesn't specify
     an encoding and Beautiful Soup can't autodetect one. Then you
     just have to specify the original encoding.
