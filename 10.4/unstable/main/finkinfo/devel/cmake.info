Description: Cross-platform Make
DescDetail: <<
CMake is used to control the software compilation process using simple 
platform and compiler independent configuration files. CMake generates 
native makefiles and workspaces that can be used in the compiler 
environment of your choice. CMake is quite sophisticated: it is possible 
to support complex environments requiring system configuration,
pre-processor generation, code generation, and template instantiation.

DescPort: <<
 Previous versions by Sylvain Cuaz.
 
 For the right linking of the GL and GLU libraries with Apple's X11,
 some of the FindOpenGL logic has to be disabled. Applications that use
 OpenGL with X11 need to declare the libraries. For an example, see the
 vtk-py.info file. 

 The patch file contains some code from CMake CVS for getting the right
 file names for dylibs.
 The right install_name still has to be introduced by hand, 
 the INSTALLNAME_DIR mechanism which is present in this version
 or in current CVS does not work.
