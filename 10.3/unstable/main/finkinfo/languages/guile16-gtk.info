Description: Glue code to link gtk to guile
DescDetail: << 
This is some glue code to make Gtk accessible from Guile.  It provides
a convenient interface for Scheme programmers to develop graphical
user interfaces.  This version of guile-gtk is stripped down and
intended for people who want to use Gtk+-1.2 without Gnome.
Guile-gtk was started by Marius Vollmer <mvo@zagadka.ping.de> and is
currently mantained by Ariel Rios<ariel@arcavia.com> and other
intrepid Guile hackers around the world.
