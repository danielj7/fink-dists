Description: GNU Internet File Transfer project
DescDetail: <<
giFT is a `recursive' acronym for `giFT: Internet File Transfer'. The
giFT project is actually a collection of several components together:
the giFT daemon (which acts as bridge to the actual file sharing
protocols), OpenFT (a p2p network designed to exploit all the
functionality giFT supports), and a user interface front-end.

Note that giFT is alpha software (but it works!), and is still very much
under development!  You should update *often*.
<<
DescUsage: <<
Make sure you run giFT-setup before using giFT.
I usually open a termnial window and run giFT, and then in another
window run giFT-shell or giFTcurs.

man giFT, OpenFT.conf  and gift.conf. They are your friends
sample config files are in %p/etc/giFT this entire dir can be copied to
~/.giFT

please do not beg for help on #gift. They *will* flame you if the
information you seek is in the docs. You have been warned.

You can ask me for help in #fink, my nick is cirdan. Just private msg
me.

giFT -d detaches giFT from the term.

Share! (there is no meta-info or resource forks. Files with resource
forks must be encoded somehow: .bin .sit .dmg, etc.)

:-)
<<
DescPort: <<
Fixes an rmdir call because of kernel bug in 10.1

There is limited meta information support in this version, and it does not
handle resource forks.
