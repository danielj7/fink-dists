Description: Cataloging system for documentation
DescDetail: <<
ScrollKeeper is a cataloging system for documentation. It manages
documentation metadata, as specified by the Open Source Metadata
Framework (OMF), as well as metadata which it extracts directly
from DocBook documents.  It provides a simple API to allow help
browsers to find, sort, and search the document catalog. Some
day it may also be able to communicate with catalog servers on
the Net to search for documents which are not on the local system.
<<
DescUsage: <<
It has been obsoleted by the rarian system: the "scrollkeeper" package
is actually implemented by the "rarian-compat" package now, but is
kept and still a useful package until fink fully implements rarian.
