OpenLayers makes it easy to put a dynamic map in any web page. It can
display map tiles and markers loaded from any source. MetaCarta
developed the initial version of OpenLayers and gave it to the public
to further the use of geographic information of all kinds. OpenLayers
is completely free, Open Source JavaScript, released under the BSD
License.

OpenLayers is a pure JavaScript library for displaying map data in
most modern web browsers, with no server-side dependencies. OpenLayers
implements a (still-developing) JavaScript API for building rich
web-based geographic applications, similar to the Google Maps and MSN
Virtual Earth APIs, with one important difference -- OpenLayers is
Free Software, developed for and by the Open Source software
community.

Furthermore, OpenLayers implements industry-standard methods for
geographic data access, such as the OpenGIS Consortium's Web Mapping
Service (WMS) and Web Feature Service (WFS) protocols. Under the hood,
OpenLayers is written in object-oriented JavaScript, using components
from Prototype.js and the Rico library. The OpenLayers code base
already has hundreds of unit tests, via the Test.AnotherWay framework.

As a framework, OpenLayers is intended to separate map tools from map
data so that all the tools can operate on all the data sources. This
separation breaks the proprietary silos that earlier GIS revolutions
have taught civilization to avoid. The mapping revolution on the
public Web should benefit from the experience of history.
