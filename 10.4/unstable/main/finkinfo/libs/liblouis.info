Description: Braille translation and back-translation library
DescDetail: <<
	Liblouis is an open-source braille translator and back-translator. It features
	support for computer and literary braille, supports contracted and
	uncontracted translation for many, many languages (Arabic, Armenian,
	Bulgarian, Chinese, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, Esperanto,
	Estonian, Finish, French, Gaelic, German, Greek, Icelandic, Italian,
	Lithuanian, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Slovakian,
	Spanish, Swedish, Turkish, Vietnamese, Welsh) and has support for
	hyphenation. New languages can easily be added through tables that
	support a rule- or dictionary based approach. Included are also tools for
	testing and debugging tables. Liblouis also supports math braille (Nemeth
	and Marburg). The formatting of braille is provided by the companion
	project liblouisxml. 
	Liblouis has features to support screen-reading programs. This has led to
	its use in two Open Source screenreaders, NVDA and Orca. It is also used
	in some commercial assistive technology applications such as from
	ViewPlus for example. 
	Liblouis is based on the translation routines in the BRLTTY screenreader
	for Linux. It has, however, gone far beyond these routines. It is named in
	honor of Louis Braille. In Linux and Mac OSX it is a shared library, and in
	Windows it is a DLL.
