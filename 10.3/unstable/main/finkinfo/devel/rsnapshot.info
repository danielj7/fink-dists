DescDetail: <<
rsnapshot is a filesystem snapshot utility for 
making backups of local and remote systems. 
rsnapshot is written entirely in Perl.

Using rsync and hard links, it is possible to 
keep multiple, full backups instantly available. 
The disk space required is just a little more 
than the space of one full backup, plus 
incrementals. 

Depending on your configuration, it is quite 
possible to set up in just a few minutes. Files 
can be restored by the users who own them, 
without the root user getting involved. 

There are no tapes to change, so once it's set
up, you may never need to think about it again.
