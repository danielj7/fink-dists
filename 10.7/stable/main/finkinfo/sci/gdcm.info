Description: Grassroots DICOM library
DescDetail: <<
Whenever medical data, especially medical image data, is generated in a
clinical environment, that data must be stored such that it can be retrieved by
the same hospital either immediately, or after several years to determine the
effectiveness of a course of treatment and to allow comparisons of multiple
images for the same patient.

Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) is a standard that
governs this capability by specifying handling, storing, printing, and
transmitting information in medical imaging.

Grassroots DICOM (GDCM) is an implementation of the DICOM standard designed to
be open source so that researchers may access clinical data directly. GDCM
includes a file format definition and a network communications protocol, both
of which should be extended to provide a full set of tools for a researcher or
small medical imaging vendor to interface with an existing medical database.
GDCM is an open source implementation of the DICOM standard. It offers some
compatibility with ACR-NEMA 1.0 & 2.0 files (raw files).

DescPackaging: <<
	Docs use TeX for generation, so we aren't building them in this package.
	Python bindings don't work yet.
	Examples use Qt for their build, so we'll pull those into their own package 
	at some point.
