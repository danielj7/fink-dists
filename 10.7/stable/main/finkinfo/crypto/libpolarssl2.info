Package: libpolarssl2
Version: 1.2.3
Revision: 2
Description: Lightweight SSL/TLS library
DescDetail: <<
	PolarSSL is an SSL library written in ANSI C. PolarSSL makes it easy
	for developers to include cryptographic and SSL/TLS capabilities in
	their (embedded) products with as little hassle as possible. It is
	designed to be readable, documented, tested, loosely coupled and
	portable.
	
	It also includes an OpenSSL compatible wrapper header.
	
	Example programs are installed into %p/share/doc/%n/examples
	rather than %p/bin to avoid possible conflicts.

# Tests are only built when cmake thinks we're using gcc.
