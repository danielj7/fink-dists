DescDetail: <<
This class facilitates building frameworks of several classes that
inter-operate. It was first designed and built for "HTML::Mason", in which
the Compiler, Lexer, Interpreter, Resolver, Component, Buffer, and several
other objects must create each other transparently, passing the appropriate
parameters to the right class, possibly substituting their own subclass for
any of these objects.
