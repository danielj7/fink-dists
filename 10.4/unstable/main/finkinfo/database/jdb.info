DescDetail: <<
JDB is a package of commands for manipulating flat-ASCII databases
from shell scripts. JDB is useful to process medium amounts of data
(with very little data you'd do it by hand, with megabytes you might
want a real database). 

JDB is built on flat-ASCII databases. By storing data in simple text
files and processing it with pipelines it is easy to experiment (in
the shell) and look at the output. The original implementation of this
idea was /rdb, a commercial product described in the book "UNIX
relational database management: application development in the UNIX
environment" by Rod Manis, Evan Schaffer, and Robert Jorgensen.
