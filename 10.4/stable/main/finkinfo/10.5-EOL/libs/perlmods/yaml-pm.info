# Additional Info:
DescDetail: <<
You probably think YAML stands for "Yet Another Markup Language". It ain't!
YAML is really a data serialization language. But if you want to think of it as
a markup, that's OK with me. A lot of people try to use XML as a serialization
format.

#Tests disabled since they need a newer test-simple-pm module (>= 0.54-1).
#If the test-simple-pm module is too old, the tests will hang and fill all
#system memory.
^-- now that we're OS X 10.5+ only, we have perl >= 5.8.8 as the
unvarianted version, which comes with Test::Simple >= 0.62

Don't see anything bad happening with older ExtUtils::MakeMaker, so no
need to force a higher version that is only available as a varianted
fink package (which would entail varianting or other messes here). See
inc/Module/Install/Makefile.pm for notes why it was wanted and that
older is accepted in some situations already anyway.
