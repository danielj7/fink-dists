Description: Alternate Window Manager, works in XDarwin's rootless env.
DescDetail: <<
Blackbox is yet another addition to the list of window 
managers for the Open Group's X Window System, Version 11 Release 6 
and above. Blackbox is built with C++, sharing no common code with 
any other window manager (even though the graphics implementation 
is similar to that of Window Maker).

This version of blackbox has been patched to be more usable under 
rootless X. The menus, which were previously only accessible via 
clicking on the root window, may now be opened from the (otherwise
fairly useless) toolbar at the bottom of the screen.
