Description: Converts rtf format to several other formats
DocFiles: CHANGES COPYING README
DescDetail: <<
UnRTF is a moderately complicated converter from RTF to other formats,
including HTML, LaTeX, text, and PostScript. Converting to HTML, it
supports tables, fonts, colors, embedded images, hyperlinks, paragraph
alignment among other things. All other conversions are "alpha"--just
begun.
Usage example: 'unrtf foo.rtf --html > foo.html'
See the man page for options, and the doc for limitations.

DescPort: <<
Previous versions by Matt Stephenson.
Patched Makefile and set '-no-cpp-precomp' in CPPFlags to allow source to
compile. Patched various c files to use 'stdlib.h' instead of 'malloc.h'.
Patched malloc.c to avoid warning casting pointer from integer.
