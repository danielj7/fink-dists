DescDetail:<<
       LaCheck is a general purpose consistency checker for LaTeX
       documents.  It reads a LaTeX document and displays warning
       messages,  if  it finds bad sequences. It should be noted,
       that the badness is very subjective.  LaCheck is  designed
       to  help  find  common  mistakes in LaTeX documents, espe-
       cially those made by beginners.
