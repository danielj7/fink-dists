DescDetail: <<
MapServer is an OpenSource development environment for constructing
spatially enabled Internet-web applications. The software builds upon
other popular OpenSource or freeware systems including Shapelib, 
FreeType, Proj.4, GDAL/OGR.
<<
DescUsage: <<
To use mapserver you either copy the directory or the file: 
 cp %p/share/mapserver /Library/WebServer/CGI-Executables
or 
 cp %p/share/mapserver/mapserv /Library/WebServer/CGI-Executables
You may, of course, add symlink to CGI-Executables after you edit httpd.conf
to have Options: FollowSymLinks ExecCGI.

DescPort: <<

The binaries are now also installed in bin so that they can be used
from the command line.  Should mapserver depend on apache2 and put it
into the apache2 cgi directory?
