Description:  Auto-execute scripts as you traverse dirs
DescDetail: <<
ondir executes a script when entering or leaving a directory. It also
executes all scripts for the intermediate directories between two.  A
perfect example of the usefulness of this program is modifying your
umask when changing into your public_html directory.
<<
DescUsage: <<
For ondir to work, you must copy the commands in
%p/share/doc/ondir/scripts.tcsh (or .sh) into your .cshrc or
.tcshrc. Then add your directory traversal commands into your
~/.ondirrc per the man page.
<<
DescPort: <<
Using make LDFLAGS to get rid of the -s flag added in Makefile.in.
