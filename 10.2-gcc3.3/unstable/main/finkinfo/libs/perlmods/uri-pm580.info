Description: Perl module that implements the URI class
DescDetail: <<
  This package contains the URI.pm module with friends.  The module
  implements the URI class.  Objects of this class represent Uniform
  Resource Identifier (URI) references as specified in RFC 2396.

  URI objects can be used to access and manipulate the various
  components that make up these strings.  There are also methods to
  combine URIs in various ways.

  The URI class replaces the URI::URL class that used to be distributed
  with libwww-perl.  This package contains an emulation of the old
  URI::URL interface.  The emulated URI::URL implements both the old and
  the new interface.
