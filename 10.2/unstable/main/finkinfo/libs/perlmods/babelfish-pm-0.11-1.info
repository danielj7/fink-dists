Description: Perl5 interface to babelfish
DescDetail: <<
This module is a simple perl front-end to the Babelfish translation
server.  It's more fun than useful, but it might have a place in
IRC/talk clients or perhaps a translating web proxy. It makes an
attempt at breaking longer pieces of text up into chunks that
Babelfish can handle and then reassembling them.
