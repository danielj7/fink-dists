DescDetail: <<
Locale::Maketext is a base class providing a framework for
localization and inheritance-based lexicons, as described in my
article in The Perl Journal #13 (a corrected version of which appears
in this dist).
See the pod in Locale::Maketext and Locale::Maketext::TPJ13,
and see also File::Findgrep.
Questions, bug reports, useful code bits, and suggestions for
Worms should be sent to me at sburke@cpan.org
