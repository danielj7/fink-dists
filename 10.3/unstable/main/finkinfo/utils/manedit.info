DescDetail: <<
ManEdit is a UNIX manual page editor and viewer, it is designed specifically for the editing of the UNIX manual page format using an integrated XML interface.

Although some developers with more resources can create a source document using a much more advanced editor and then export to multiple file formats, the average UNIX contributor is not up to that mountainous task. So to make UNIX documentation simpler, there is ManEdit!
