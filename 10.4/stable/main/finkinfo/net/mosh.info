Description: SSH replacement for unreliable networks
DescDetail: <<
Remote terminal application that allows roaming, supports intermittent
connectivity, and provides intelligent local echo and line editing of
user keystrokes.

Mosh is a replacement for SSH. It's more robust and responsive,
especially over Wi-Fi, cellular, and long-distance links.
