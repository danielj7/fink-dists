Description: Compute band structures of photonic crystals
DescDetail: <<
This program computes definite-frequency eigenstates of Maxwell's
equations in periodic dielectric structures for arbitrary wavevectors,
using fully-vectorial and three-dimensional methods. It is especially
designed for the study of photonic crystals (a.k.a. photonic band-gap
materials), but is also applicable to many other problems in optics,
such as waveguides and resonator systems. It was written by Steven G.
Johnson.
