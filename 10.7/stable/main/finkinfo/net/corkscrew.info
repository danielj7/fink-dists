DescDetail: <<
Corkscrew is a tool for tunneling SSH through HTTP proxies, but
...you might find another use for it.

Corkscrew has been tested with the following HTTP proxies :
 * Gauntlet
 * CacheFlow
 * JunkBuster
 * Apache mod_proxy
<<
DescUsage: <<
Setting up Corkscrew with SSH/OpenSSH is very simple.  Adding
the following line to your ~/.ssh/config file will usually do
the trick (replace proxy.example.com and 8080 with correct values):

ProxyCommand /usr/local/bin/corkscrew proxy.example.com 8080 %h %p
