Description: Peer to peer sync of mailboxes over IMAP
DescPackaging: <<
 This version is compiled with g++-3.3, even in the 10.4 tree.  If it is
 ever updated to a more recent compiler, any packages which depend on
 this one must be updated at the same time.

 g++4 (4.0.1 xcode 2.5) gives warning:
   mailsync.cc:284: warning: non-local variable '<anonymous enum> mode' uses anonymous type
<<
DescPort: <<
	dmacks switched to external imap and fixed to recognize darwin
	shared-lib extension and pam location as of 4.5.3-1002.
<<
DescDetail: <<
 Mailsync is a way of synchronizing a collection of mailboxes.  The
 algorithm is a 3-way diff.  Two mailboxes are simultaneously compared
 to a record of the state of both mailboxes at last sync.  New messages
 and message deletions are propagated between the two mailboxes.  If
 you're familiar with CVS, it's the same principle, except there's no
 opportunity for conflicts.
