Description: Placeholder package for manually installed Absoft ProFortran
DescPackaging: <<
 This package is no longer maintained, and there is no way to test it on
 10.6.  If anyone steps forward with a need for Absoft Fortran compatibility
 on 10.6, the package can be revived for that distribution.
<<
DescDetail: <<
Install this package if you have the commerical Absoft fortran
installed. It will check whether the installation is okay and provide
the 'system-fortran' virtual package.
