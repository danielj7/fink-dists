 See the .info file for a notice about a dataloss bug in this package.

DescPort: <<
 There is a serious, known bug with the upstream package. Appending an
 empty string to a file causes that file to be truncated. Hopefully,
 the upstream author will fix the bug soon. Otherwise I may try to
 patch the Fink version myself (assistance is welcome). In the
 meantime, this package should NOT move to the stable tree.
