Description: Trace bitmaps into scalable vector graphics
DescDetail: <<
Potrace is a utility for tracing a bitmap, which means, transforming a
bitmap into a smooth, scalable image. The input is a bitmap (PBM, PGM,
PPM, or BMP format), and the default output is an encapsulated
PostScript file (EPS). A typical use is to create EPS files from
scanned data, such as company or university logos, handwritten notes,
etc. The resulting image is not "jaggy" like a bitmap, but smooth. It
can then be rendered at any resolution.

Potrace can currently produce the following output formats: EPS,
PostScript, PDF, SVG (scalable vector graphics), DXF, PGM (for easy
antialiasing of pixel-based images), Gimppath, and XFig. Additional
backends might be added in the future.

Mkbitmap is a program distributed with Potrace which can be used to
pre-process the input for better tracing behavior on greyscale and
color images.
