Description: Transparent socks proxy for use with tor
DescDetail: <<
 Torsocks is an application for Linux, BSD and OS X that allows you to
 use network applications such as ssh and irssi with Tor. Torsocks
 allows you to use most socks-friendly applications in a safe way with
 Tor. It ensures that DNS requests are handled safely and explicitly
 rejects UDP traffic from the application you're using.
