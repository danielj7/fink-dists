Description: Universal sound sample translator
DescDetail: <<
 SoX (also known as Sound eXchange) translates sound samples between
 different file formats, and optionally applies various sound
 effects. SoX is intended as the Swiss Army knife of sound processing
 tools. It doesn't do anything very well, but sooner or later it comes
 in very handy.

 It is a cross-platform (Windows, Linux, MacOS X, etc.) command line
 utility that can convert various formats of computer audio files in
 to other formats. It can also apply various effects to these sound
 files, and, as an added bonus, SoX can play and record audio files on
 most platforms.

 It is compiled without ffmpeg support to make it much easier to build
 using Fink.  If you need a more powerful translator, or codecs that
 are offered in ffmpeg, install the ffmpeg package.
