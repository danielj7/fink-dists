DescDetail: <<
Fields is for curve, surface and function fitting with an emphasis on
splines, spatial data and spatial statistics. The major methods include
cubic, and thin plate splines, Kriging and compact covariances for large
data sets. The splines and Kriging methods are supporting by functions
that can determine the smoothing parameter (nugget and sill variance) by
cross validation and also by restricted maximum likelihood. A major
feature is that any covariance function implemented in R and following
a simple fields format can be used for spatial prediction. Some tailored
optimization functions are supplied for finding the MLEs for the Matern
family of covariances. There are also many useful functions for plotting
and working with spatial data as images. This package also contains an
implementation of sparse matrix methods for large spatial data sets and
currently requires the sparse matrix (spam) package. But spam is not
required for the standard spatial functions. Use help(fields) to get
started and for an overview. The fields source code is heavily commented
and provides useful explanations of numerical details in addition to
the manual pages.
