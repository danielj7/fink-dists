+Introduction
+
+	The GenInfo Software Toolbox is a set of software and data exchange 
+specifications that are used by NCBI to produce portable, modular software for 
+molecular biology.  We make this software and specifications available to the 
+community for use in its own right, or as a foundation for building other 
+tools with similar properties.  All software produced by NCBI and here 
+provided includes the following copyright notice:

+
+	In those cases where software is made available from other sources,
+other restrictions may apply.
+
+	It is available by anonymous ftp from ftp.ncbi.nih.gov. In the "toolbox"
+directory you will find the following:
+
+Directory Structure
+
+	These files are available for anonymous ftp from "ftp.ncbi.nih.gov".
+The directory structure is as follows:
+
+    toolbox       - top level toolbox directory
+		ncbi_tools		- NCBI software development toolkit and ASN.1 specs
+					most current version (3.xx). FTP the toolkit from
+                            this directory.
+		other_ncbi              - various other tools made by ncbi
+                other_tools             - a few ASN.1 tools not made by ncbi
+		vms_utils		- VMS tools for untarring and uncompressing
+
+ncbi_tools
+
+	This is the NCBI portable software toolkit.  A single compressed tar
+file contains all the code, ASN.1 specifications, and demo programs
+(including complete source code for Entrez).  This file is:
+
+ncbi.tar.Z  (Unix compressed tar file)
+ncbiZ.exe   (DOS, Windows PKZIP file)
+ncbi.hqx    (Mac self extracting archive)
+
+The contents of the files are the same except the UNIX version also includes
+the documentation. Documentation is available in the ncbi_tools/newdoc
+directory as MS Word file. A README in the files above explains installation.
+Hardcopy of the documentation and questions my be directed to
+toolbox@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
+
+vms_utils
+
+	This contains a set of utilities and instructions for VMS users to 
+untar and uncompress the files in the other directories.  Get this first if
+you are on VMS and read the instructions.  Kindly maintained by Will Gilbert
+of Whitehead Institute.  Also contains other VMS utilities such as drivers
+for ISO9660 CDROMS.
+==========================================================================
+in other_tools directory:
+
+isode
+
+	This is a very large system of tools from ISO for use in prototyping
+OSI applications.  It includes many large tools in one file, and 5 volumes of 
+PostScript documentation in the other file.  The documentation is good for 
+learning about OSI.  There is an ASN.1 compiler which will give you the 
+flavor of what can be done with these tools.  This is not a simple or terribly 
+efficient system.
+
+
+osikit
+
+	This is a set of tools from NIST (formerly the Bureau of Standards) 
+to assist development of OSI applications.  It includes the free value tool,
+which can read and validate an ASN.1 specification and produce an encoder and
+decoder for both the print form and basic encoding rules form.  We find it
+very useful for checking syntax on both specifications and data objects.  The
+limitation is that in the print form, the tool can only accept VisibleStrings
+all on one line, and less than 200 chars in length.
+
+
+asn_pmp
+
+	A parser for ASN.1 print files written by Peter Karp.  It parses print 
+files into S expressions which makes a simple, flexible way to input data 
+objects.  It does no checking on syntax or content.  See the README for more 
+details.
