Description: Numerical diff tool
DescDetail: <<
numdiff is a little program that can be used to compare putatively similar
files line by line and field by field, ignoring small numeric differences
or/and different numeric formats.  Equivalently, Numdiff is a program with
the capability to appropriately compare files containing numerical fields
(and not only). By default, Numdiff assumes the fields are separated by 
white-space characters (spaces, horizontal tabulations and newlines), 
but the user can also specify its list of separators through the 
option -s, see the User Manual.

When you compare a couple of such files, what you want to obtain usually is 
a list of the numerical fields in the second file which numerically differ 
from the corresponding fields in the first file. Well known tools like diff, 
cmp or wdiff can not be used to this purpose: they can not recognize whether
a difference between two numerical fields is only due to the notation or is
actually a difference of numerical values. Moreover, you could also want to
ignore differences in numerical values as long as they do not exceed a
certain threshold. In other words, you could desire to neglect all small
numerical differences too. However, programs like diff and wdiff can not be
used to ignore small numerical differences, since they do not even know what
a numerical difference is. That is why I decided to implement Numdiff.

In writing this program I was inspired by ndiff,
a GPL'ed software by Nelson H. F. Beebe of the
Salt Lake City University, see

http://www.math.utah.edu/~beebe/software/ndiff

ndiff is a good tool and I used it for a while, but I did not completely 
like the way it works and so numdiff was born. 
Although ndiff inspired numdiff, they are completely different from the 
viewpoint of the source code: numdiff has been entirely written from scratch 
with addition of source code from GNU bc, GNU diff and GNUlib.
