DescDetail: <<
SML/NJ is an implementation of the Standard ML programming language,
produced and maintained by researchers at Bell Labs, Princeton, Yale,
and AT&T Research.  Standard ML has many features, including type
safety, algebraic data types with pattern matching, higher-order
functions, and a sophisticated module system. It is especially
well-suited for writing compilers and other language processors.

This package includes the interactive compiler (sml), the compilation
manager (CM), compiler generation tools (ml-lex, ml-yacc), the Basis
library, and the SML/NJ library.

Install this package if you want to program in SML.

DescPackaging: <<
Based on Christopher League's smlnj*.info package info.

Command line programs are placed under %p/bin, symlinked to smlnj-script, a
launcher based on Christopher League's packaging. The launcher executes smlnj
runtime with a given application's heap image. You can also find command line
programs in %p/lib/smlnj/bin, where the symlinks are made to a launcher script
generated by the smlnj installer. These symlinks are provided so Compilation
Manager can find them. They're not used directly by the user. The heap images
and runtime are placed in %p/lib/smlnj/bin/{.heap|.run} respectively. Heap
images and runtime executables are placed with the usual ARCH-OS extension.

SML/NJ libraries are placed in %p/lib/smlnj/lib, so "pathconfig" should be
updated when new libraries are installed.

eXene does not depend on X11R6 development files to compile or run. It is
completely implemented in SML.

When the source package builds, PatchScript moves the sub-packages that are
already unpacked by Fink to where SML/NJ installer can find them. However, the
locations are arbitrary. Package maintainer needs to double check with
%b/config/unpack to find out where exactly each package goes.

TODO: maybe someday do a spilt package?
