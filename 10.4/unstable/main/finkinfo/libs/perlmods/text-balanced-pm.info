DescDetail: <<
The various extract_... subroutines may be used to extract a delimited
substring, possibly after skipping a specified prefix string.  By
default, that prefix is optional whitespace (/\s*/), but you can
change it to whatever you wish (see below).

The substring to be extracted must appear at the current pos location
of the string's variable (or at index zero, if no pos position is
defined).  In other words, the extract_... subroutines don't extract
the first occurance of a substring anywhere in a string (like an
unanchored regex would).  Rather, they extract an occurance of the
substring appearing immediately at the current matching position in
the string (like a \G-anchored regex would).
