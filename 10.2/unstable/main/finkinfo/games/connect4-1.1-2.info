Description: Text-based Connect Four game.
DescDetail: <<
An exploration into artificial intelligence. 

There are many computer players. Each uses slightly different
heuristics. When you set the computer's level you are essentially
telling it how many moves to look ahead in the beginning (it looks ahead
further as the game progresses). You can play human vs. human, human vs.
computer, or computer vs. computer. When the computer fights itself you
can set a different level and heuristic for each player.

The AI can be quite good, making it difficult to win if you do not 
make good moves in the early game.
