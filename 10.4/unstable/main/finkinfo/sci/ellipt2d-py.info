Package: ellipt2d-py%type_pkg[python]
Version: 1.8
Revision: 1
Description: General purpose, finite-element tool
DescDetail: <<
* Solves equations of the form: -div(F*grad(v)) + gv = s, where F (a
   tensor), g and s are user-supplied functions of x and y.
* Real and complex
* Eigenvalue problems
* Full user control over boundary conditions (Dirichlet, Neumann and
  Robin).
* Ellipt2d supports:
         1. Structured meshes.
         2. Quality unstructured meshes with arbitrary boundaries
            based on TRIANGLE
* Problems can be real or complex
* Subset of ELLIPT2D runs with Jython
* Choice between built-in conjugate gradient solvers and SuperLU
  sparse matrix solver.
* Easily extendable, object oriented design.
* Code is quick to write and understand because it's based on the
  scripting language Python.

* Optional interaction through a graphical user interface (Tkinter).
* Interfaces to 3rd party visualization tools: OpenDX, AVS/Express,
  VTK and plotMTV.
* Tk graphics-based tools for debugging.

Ellipt2d is the ideal finite-element, rapid development tool for
problems with up to 100 000's nodes.
