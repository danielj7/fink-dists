Description: Perl module for biology
DescDetail: <<
Bioperl is a collection of perl modules that facilitate the development of 
perl scripts for bioinformatics applications. As such, it does not include 
ready to use programs in the sense that many commercial packages and free 
web-based interfaces (eg Entrez, SRS) do. On the other hand, bioperl does 
provide reusable perl modules that facilitate writing perl scripts for 
sequence manipulation, accessing of databases using a range of data formats 
and execution and parsing of the results of various molecular biology 
programs including Blast, clustalw, TCoffee, genscan, ESTscan and HMMER. 
Consequently, bioperl enables developing scripts that can analyze large 
quantities of sequence data in ways that are typically difficult or impossible 
with web based systems.

DescUsage: <<
Additional functionality for bioperl (eg for maintaining a local database) 
can be obtained by installing the required perl modules before installing 
bioperl-pm. See /sw/share/doc/bioperl-pm/INSTALL. Note that not all optional 
perl modules are available through fink.

All examples, docs, etc can be found in /sw/share/bioperl-pm/.
