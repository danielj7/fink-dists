Description: Functional group analysis of molecules

DescDetail: <<
If invoked as "checkmol", this program reads 2D and 3D molecular structure
files in various formats (Tripos Alchemy "mol", Tripos SYBYL "mol2", MDL "mol")
and describes the molecule either by its functional groups or by a set of 
descriptors useful for database pre-screening (number of rings, sp2-hybridized
carbons, aromatic bonds, etc.).

If invoked as "matchmol", the program reads two individual 2D or 3D molecular
structure files in various formats (see above) and checks if the first molecule
(the "needle") is a substructure of the second one (the "haystack").
"Haystack" can also be a MDL SD-file (containing multiple MOL files);
if invoked with "-" as file argument, both "needle" and "haystack" are
read as an SD-file from standard input, assuming the first entry in
the SDF to be the "needle"; output: entry number + ":F" (false) or ":T" (true)
