Description: High performance assertion and debugging library
DescDetail: <<
Nana is a development library that provides support for assertion
checks, improved debugging and configurable logging in C and C++ when
using the GNU compilers.

Better details at http://www.cs.ntu.edu.au/homepages/pjm/nana-home/
<<
DescUsage: <<
The nana debugging libraries are useful for software developers who
understand the value of runtime assertions. The first step to using
nana is to read about the nana debugging macros in the nana manual and
insert appropriate macros into your source code.

The nana headers can be included by compiling with '-I%p/include/nana'
The static nana library will be linked in with '-L%p/lib -lnana'
