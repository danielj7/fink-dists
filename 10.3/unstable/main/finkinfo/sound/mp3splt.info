DescDetail: <<
Mp3Splt is a command line utility to split mp3 (VBR supported) and ogg
files selecting a begin and an end time position, without decoding. It's
very useful to split large mp3/ogg to make smaller files or to split
entire albums to obtain original tracks. If you want to split an album,
you can select split points and filenames manually or you can get them
automatically from CDDB (internet or a local file) or from .cue files.
Supports also automatic silence split, that can be used also to adjust
cddb/cue splitpoints.
Otherwise if you have a file created either with Mp3Wrap or AlbumWrap
you can extract tracks just in few seconds.
Mp3split is completely FREE (under GPL License) and supported by Open
Source Community.
