DescDetail: <<
Syntax is, first and foremost, a lexical analysis framework.  It supports
pluggable syntax modules, and comes with modules for Ruby, XML, and YAML.

What does it mean, a "lexical analysis framework"?  It means you can use
Syntax to take a body of text representing instructions in some syntax
(like Ruby), and break that text into tokens.

What is that good for?  Well, a few things. You could concievably use it
to count the number of classes in a system, or the number of lines of
code per method.  But Syntax was written specifically with syntax
highlighting in mind.
