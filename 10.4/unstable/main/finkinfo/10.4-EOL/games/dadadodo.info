Description: Dadaist phrase generator
DescDetail: <<
DadaDodo is a program that analyses texts for word probabilities, and
then generates random sentences based on that.  Sometimes these
sentences are nonsense; but sometimes they cut right through to the
heart of the matter, and reveal hidden meanings.
