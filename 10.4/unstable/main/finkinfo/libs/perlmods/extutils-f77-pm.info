DescDetail: <<
This module tries to figure out how to link C programs with Fortran
subroutines on your system.  Basically one must add a list of
Fortran runtime libraries.  The problem is their location and name
varies with each OS/compiler combination!

This module tries to implement a simple 'rule-of-thumb' database for
various flavours of UNIX systems.  A simple self-documenting Perl
database of knowledge/code for figuring out how to link for various
combinations of OS and compiler is embedded in the modules Perl code.
Please help save the world by sending database entries for your
system to kgb@aaoepp.aao.gov.au
