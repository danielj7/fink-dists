Description: Tool to make writing Python modules easy
DescDetail: <<
 Cython is a language specially designed for writing Python extension
 modules. It's designed to bridge the gap between the nice,
 high-level, easy-to-use world of Python and the messy, low-level
 world of C. Cython is based upon the well-known Pyrex package, but
 supports more cutting edge functionality and optimizations. To use
 the cython compiler, type cython at the prompt.
 
 Note: This package uses update-alternatives to allow cython for different 
 versions of python to be installed simultaneously.  '%p/bin/cython' will 
 always point to the highest installed version; use (e.g.) 'cython-py24'
 to choose others.
