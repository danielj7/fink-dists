Description: Themeable, featureful window manager
DescPort: <<
Uses autoconf. Needs patches for some unguarded LC_MESSAGES
usage. Needs help to put message catalogs in the right
directory. bindir is specified so that it gets encoded correctly into
the enlightenment.install script.

The configure script detects that it needs libintl, but doesn't add
the appropriate library flag. We set LIBS to work around this.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
Some theme files have inappropriate permissions. The ownership should
probably be fixed too, but it doesn't hurt enough yet. :-)
<<
DescUsage: <<
If you want to use Enlightenment as a stand-alone desktop environment
(i.e. without GNOME), you can run 'enlightenment.install' to create
appropriate X11 startup files (.xsession / .xinitrc).

To use Enlightenment with GNOME, leave .xinitrc alone and instead
select it in the Window Manager panel of the GNOME Control Center.
