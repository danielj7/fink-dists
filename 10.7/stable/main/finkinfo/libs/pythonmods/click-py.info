DescDetail: <<
Click is a Python package for creating beautiful command line interfaces
in a composable way with as little code as necessary.  It's the "Command
Line Interface Creation Kit".  It's highly configurable but comes with
sensible defaults out of the box.

It aims to make the process of writing command line tools quick and fun
while also preventing any frustration caused by the inability to implement
an intended CLI API.

Click in three points:
-   arbitrary nesting of commands
-   automatic help page generation
-   supports lazy loading of subcommands at runtime
