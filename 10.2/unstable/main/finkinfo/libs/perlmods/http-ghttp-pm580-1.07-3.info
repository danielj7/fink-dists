Description: Perl interface to the gnome ghttp library
DescDetail: <<
This is a fairly low level interface to the Gnome project's libghttp, which
allows you to process HTTP requests to HTTP servers. There also exists a
slightly higher level interface - a simple get() function which takes a URI as
a parameter. This is not exported by default, you have to ask for it
explicitly.
