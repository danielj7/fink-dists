Package: gopenmol
Version: 3.00
Revision: 1
GCC: 3.3
Description: Molecular visualization and analysis program
DescDetail: <<
With gOpenMol small molecules, and to lesser extent protein
structures, as well as the chemical properties, total electron
densities and molecule orbitals of small molecules can be visualized
and analyzed. Data from a variety of computational chemistry programs
such as TurboMole, Gaussian, Gamess, etc., can be analyzed if the
output files from these programs have been converted into the
.plt-file format understood by gOpenMol. Moreover, dynamics done with,
e.g., InsightII can be visualized and a short mpeg animation of the
dynamics files generated.

Require modern tcltk to avoid bug in line-endings emitted from older tclsh

Standard darwin malloc.h fix

The build/install process doesn't understand how to install in a temp
packaging location for later installation somewhere else, so need to
fix the pathnames in some runtime scripts.

Package installs lots of docs in its private hierarchies, so move to
or make links from the standard share/doc/%n location.

Patch install.mk to not install libs that we already have from other
Fink packages. Set our Depends for each of those packages >= version
that comes in Source tarball.

Put libgopenmol in private lib/ instead of private bin/

Disabled icon8 because there are too many compiling problems
(non-portable code and old coding standards).

No default $TMP or $TMPDIR, so set GOM_TEMP in environment.txt

The "rungOpenMol" script just sets variables (many of which are not
needed for fink's installation and/or are not appropriate for OS X)
and calls the actual "gopenmol" program, so put the key variable in a
profile.d and patch install.mk to omit the wrapper. Symlink "gopenmol"
from %p/bin.

Data files get installed in %p/share but program looks in %p/lib
(==$GOM_ROOT), so symlink them to the GOM_ROOT location.

Utility programs are in %p/lib/gOpenMol-%v/bin so you have to either
add that to yout PATH or call the programs using the full pathname.
This is so we don't conflict with (for example) imagemagick's convert
program. This will eventually be handled automatically via a splitoff
for placing these programs in PATH and/or using alternatives.

Make sure local -I flags go ahead of global ones.

Implements a non-standard dependency-tracking configure flag. How odd.

Make sure plugins build aborts if any plugins/* build fails.

nmedit failure if building shared (misformatted symbol that doesn't 
exist anyway),
  https://postit.csc.fi/sympa/arc/gopenmol/2007-01/msg00002.html
Disabling shared disables plugins, which causes compiling to failm
  https://postit.csc.fi/sympa/arc/gopenmol/2007-01/msg00012.html
#define ENABLE_EXTENSIONS causes API macros to be defined, but still
no compile due to missing makefile target,
  https://postit.csc.fi/sympa/arc/gopenmol/2007-01/msg00012.html
Hack gomapi.exp to remove bogus symbol.

Library interface is not guaranteed to be stable (compatibility 0.0.0
and placed in %v-specific path), so no hope for true Shlibs policy.
Could off-load libs/headers into into %N%v-{shlibs,dev} if others need
a stable way to link it.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
  Starting in gopenmol-3.00-1, headers are in %p/lib/gOpenMol-%v/include
  not %p/include, and %N-dev is re-absorbed into %N.

DescUsage: <<
  May not run correctly over remote X11
