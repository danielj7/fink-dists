Description: Extreme High Speed matching for IP Ranges,
DescDetail: <<
This module provides you with an efficient way to match an IP address
against one or more I ranges. Speed is the key issue here. If you have
to check several million IP addresses, as can happen with big logs,
every millisecond counts. If your way to check an address involve a
method call and some temporary variables, a lot of time is burnt.  In
such a time-critica loop you don't want to make subroutine calls at
all, as they involve stack operations.
