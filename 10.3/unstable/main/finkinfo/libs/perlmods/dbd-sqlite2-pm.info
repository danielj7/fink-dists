DescDetail: <<
SQLite is a public domain RDBMS database engine that you can find at 
http://www.hwaci.com/sw/sqlite/.

Rather than ask you to install SQLite first, because SQLite is public domain,
DBD::SQLite includes the entire thing in the distribution. So in order to get
a fast transaction capable RDBMS working for your perl project you simply have
to install this module, and nothing else.

SQLite supports the following features:
- Implements a large subset of SQL92
  See http://www.hwaci.com/sw/sqlite/lang.html for details.
- A complete DB in a single disk file
  Everything for your database is stored in a single disk file,
  making it easier to move things around than with DBD::CSV.
- Atomic commit and rollback
  Yes, DBD::SQLite is small and light, but it supports full transactions!
- Extensible
  User-defined aggregate or regular functions can be registered
  with the SQL parser.

There's lots more to it, so please refer to the docs on the SQLite web page,
listed above, for SQL details. Also refer to DBI for details on how to
use DBI itself.
