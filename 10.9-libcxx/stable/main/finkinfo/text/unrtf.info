DescDetail: <<
UnRTF is a moderately complicated converter from RTF to other formats,
including HTML, LaTeX, text, and PostScript. Converting to HTML, it
supports tables, fonts, colors, embedded images, hyperlinks, paragraph
alignment among other things. All other conversions are "alpha"--just
begun.
Usage example: 'unrtf foo.rtf --html > foo.html'
See the man page for options, and the doc for limitations.

DescPort: <<
Previous versions by Matt Stephenson and Michele Garoche.
Patched various c files to use 'stdlib.h' instead of 'malloc.h'.
Patched malloc.c to avoid warning casting pointer from integer.

Don't use upstream's symlinks to automake-1.13 files in /usr (irrelevant for us)
