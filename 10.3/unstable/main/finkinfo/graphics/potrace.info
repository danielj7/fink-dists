Description: Trace bitmaps into scalable vector graphics
DescDetail: <<
Potrace is a utility for tracing a bitmap, which means, transforming a
bitmap into a smooth, scalable image. The input is a portable bitmap
(PBM), and the default output is an encapsulated PostScript file
(EPS). A typical use is to create EPS files from scanned data, such as
company or university logos, handwritten notes, etc. The resulting
image is not "jaggy" like a bitmap, but smooth. It can then be
rendered at any resolution.

Potrace can currently read pnm (pbm, pgm, ppm), and bmp, and produce
the following output formats: EPS, PostScript, PS, SVG, PGM, gimppath,
and xfig. The mkbitmap utility can be used to transform color or
grayscale images (pnm or bmp) into high-quality bitmaps.
