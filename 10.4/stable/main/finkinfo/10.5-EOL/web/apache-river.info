DescDetail:<<
Apache river is aimed at development and advancement of Jini 
technology core infrastructure.Jini technology is a service 
oriented architecture that defines a programming model which 
both exploits and extends Java technology to enable the 
construction of secure,distributed systems which are 
adaptive to change.
Jini technology can be used to build adaptive network systems 
that are scalable ,evolvable and flexible as typically required in 
dynamic computing environments.
