Hot-babe is a small graphical utility which displays the system activity in a
very special way. When the CPU is idle, it displays a dressed girl, and when
the activity goes up, as the temperature increases, the girl begins to undress,
to finish totally naked when the system activity reaches 100%. Of course, if
you can be shocked by nudity, don't use it!
