Description: Text2html function marks up plain text as HTML
DescDetail: <<
The text2html function marks up plain text as HTML.  By
default it converts HTML metacharacters into the
corresponding entities.  More sophisticated transformations,
such as splitting the text into paragraphs or marking up
bulleted lists, can be carried out by setting the
appropriate options.
