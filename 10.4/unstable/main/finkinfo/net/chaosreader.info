DescDetail: <<
A open source tool to trace TCP/UDP/... sessions and fetch application data
from snoop or tcpdump logs. This is a type of "any-snarf" program, as it will
fetch telnet sessions, FTP files, HTTP transfers (HTML, GIF, JPEG, ...), SMTP
emails, ... from the captured data inside network traffic logs. A html index
file is created that links to all the session details, including realtime
replay programs for telnet, rlogin, IRC, X11 or VNC sessions; and reports such
as image reports and HTTP GET/POST content reports. Chaosreader can also run
in standalone mode - where it invokes tcpdump or snoop (if they are available)
to create the log files and then processes them.
