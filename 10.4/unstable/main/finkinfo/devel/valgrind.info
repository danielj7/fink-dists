Package: valgrind
Version: 3.5.0
Revision: 0.9511.1
Description: Debugging and profiling tool
DescDetail: <<
	Valgrind is an award-winning instrumentation framework for building
	dynamic analysis tools. There are Valgrind tools that can automatically
	detect many memory management and threading bugs, and profile your
	programs in detail. You can also use Valgrind to build new tools.

	The Valgrind distribution currently includes six production-quality
	tools: a memory error detector, two thread error detectors, a cache and
	branch-prediction profiler, a call-graph generating cache profiler, and
	a heap profiler. It also includes one experimental tool, which detects
	out of bounds reads and writes of stack, global and heap arrays.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
	Based on revision 9511 from svn://svn.valgrind.org/valgrind/branches/DARWIN
	This is an experimental version and not all features are working on OS X yet.
