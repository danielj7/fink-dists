Description: Unix shell embedded in Scheme
DescDetail: <<
Scsh is a Unix Scheme shell which uses Scheme as its scripting
language. It is currently aimed primarily at scripting, rather than
interactive use, and makes for a nice Perl/Python/... replacement.
Scsh uses Scheme48 as the underlying Scheme interpreter.
<<
DescUsage: <<
After starting the scsh interpreter (scsh), you can get help by typing
  ,help
at the prompt.
