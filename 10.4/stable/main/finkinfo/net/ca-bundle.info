Description: Bundle of X.509 certificates of public CAs
DescDetail: <<
	This is a bundle of X.509 certificates of public Certificate Authorities
	(CA). These were automatically extracted from Mozilla's root certificates
	file (certdata.txt).  This file can be found in the mozilla source tree:
	'/mozilla/security/nss/lib/ckfw/builtins/certdata.txt'
	
	It contains the certificates in PEM format and therefore
	can be directly used with curl / libcurl / php_curl, or with
	an Apache+mod_ssl webserver for SSL client authentication.
	Just configure this file as the SSLCACertificateFile.
	
	The ca-bundle.crt file was taken from the Mozilla::CA perlmod.
