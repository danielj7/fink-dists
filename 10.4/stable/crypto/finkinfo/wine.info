# According to the Wine README, any GCC higher than 2.7.2 should work, but only GCC 4.x has been tested.
# See Wine's documentation/PACKAGING file for more details about dependencies.
# I may have gone overboard on these dependencies, but better safe than sorry.

DescPort: <<
Didn't find "dbus/dbus.h" : added %p/include/dbus-1.0:%p/lib/dbus-1.0/include to search path, and required CPPFLAGS
fontconfig.h : added /usr/X11R6/include
Use mesa because GL/gl.h in some versions of Apple's X11 is too old. But then to be safe mesa has also
to substitute for the glut or freeglut dep; thus put mesa in every path before %p and before /usr/X11R6.
AKH 20080828:  Doesn't build with Xcode 3.1 so until we iron that out let's use a versioned BuildDepend

DescDetail: <<
Wine is a translation layer (a program loader) capable of running Windows
applications on Linux and other POSIX compatible operating systems. Windows
programs running in Wine act as native programs would, running without the
performance or memory usage penalties of an emulator, with a similar look and
feel to other applications on your desktop.
<<
DescUsage: <<
Wine uses X Windows for its backend, so you need to start your X Server
(e.g. X11) before running Wine. In addition, Wine needs a valid DISPLAY
variable in order to find the X server. For example:

  export DISPLAY=:0.0

#Also, Wine is unable to find the FreeType libraries unless you add Fink's lib
#directory to the library path. For example:
#
#  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=%p/lib
#
# Adding export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=%p/lib/freetype219/lib seemed to give better
# results - Damian

Another note: The ~/.wine directory is supposed to be created and set up
automatically the first time you launch Wine. However, I have experienced
"wineserver: could not save registry branch" errors during the initial launch.
To fix this problem, run wineprefixcreate before launching Wine. This should
create the ~/.wine directory and populate it with the necessary files. You may
still see error messages, but the directory will be created. For example:

  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=%p/lib
  %p/bin/wineprefixcreate

This only needs to be done once.

For a quick test of Wine, run %p/bin/notepad
