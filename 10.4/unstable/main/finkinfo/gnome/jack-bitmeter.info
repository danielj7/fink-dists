Description: Diagnosis tool for JACK audio software
DescDetail: <<
 As its name might suggest, the bitmeter operates at the bare metal of JACK's
 I/O layer, looking at the 32 binary digits in each individual sample.
 There are three main areas to the bitmeter display:
 * Statistics, at the top, including the range of sample values and keeping
   a count of irregular and illegal sample values such as NaN. The statistics
   on the right are cumulative, and should ordinarily read zero.
 * Sign & Mantissa, a row of 24 coloured indicators showing the sign
   (positive or negative) and mantissa of the samples.
 * Adjusted scale, 40 smaller coloured indicators.

  The sign and mantissa statistics are show as coloured indicators which map to
 bits in the samples processed by the bitscope, with the left most indicator
 representing the sign bit, and then the mantissa left to right from most
 significant to least significant. The colour is based on the percentage of
 samples in which the associated bit was 1 over a period of 100ms or so. Blue
 indicates that all samples were 0, a light green-blue for up to 33%, green for
 33-66% (i.e. about half), and orange for more than 66%, then finally red if
 all samples are 1, a possible "stuck bit". Gray is used when no samples
 touched the associated bit.
  The "adjusted scale" shows each sample bit on a absolute scale, adjusted for
 the exponent of the sample, so that internally the bitscope records a 280-bit
 binary real. For simplicity only 40 bits are displayed, the 8 left-most bits
 are the integer part, and the remaining 32 bits after the marker are
 fractional bits. 
  The audio range of the adjusted scale is from about 200dB below FS to 40dB
 above, which would be excessive for audio work but proves useful in
 diagnosing problems at a lower level. 
  The sample rate reported by bitscope is directly from JACK. It's not used to
 perform any calculations and is purely informative.
