DescDetail: <<
Licq is an instant messaging client daemon that supports a number of 
interfaces via plug-ins, primarily KDE or Qt, but also console, and 
several utility plug-ins. Included in this package is support for AIM and 
ICQ. Support for MSN and Jabber is available as separate plug-ins.

Implemented features include messaging, chat, file transfer, whitepages, 
history, invisible list, server-side stored contacts, typing notification, 
phone book, user pictures, proxy support, user groups, network monitor 
window, themed docking skin and icon pack support, FIFO support for remote 
control, international support with Unicode and translations, per-user 
customized auto responses, SSL secure client to client connections and GPG 
encrypted messages.

DescUsage: <<
Type licq -h for commandline help.

This package only installs the base files.  At least one plug-in is
required fro Licq to function. The plug-ins are distributed in separate
packages named "licq-plugin-*".

Using licq is fairly straight-forward.  Licq itself is merely a daemon
designed to run various plugin interfaces.  We have written an advanced
gui in qt (qt4-gui) which should be used as the default plugin.  Once you
have compiled and installed Licq, unpack the plugins you wish to use into
the plugins/ directory, compile them, and then install them into
%p/lib/licq/plugins.  Then start licq with the -p option:
$ licq -p qt4-gui -- ...any options to the plugin...

Note the -- which tells the system to pass any options after that on to the
first plugin in the list.  Multiple plugins can be chained in this way:
$ licq -p qt4-gui -p email-forward -- <qt4-gui options> -- <other plugin>
