Description: The Original AT&T Korn Shell.
DescDetail: <<
 The KornShell language was designed and developed by David G. Korn
 at AT&T Bell Laboratories. It is an interactive command language
 that provides access to the UNIX system and to many other systems,
 on the many different computers and workstations on which it is
 implemented. This is Ksh93 which is intended to conform to the Shell
 Language Standard developed by the IEEE POSIX 1003.2 Shell and
 Utilities Language Committee.
<<
DescUsage: <<
 Binary and man page is installed as ksh93.
.
 To be able to use this shell as login shell (and for some other things),
 you have to add it to your /etc/shells file.
