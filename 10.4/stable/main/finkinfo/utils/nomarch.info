Package: nomarch
Version: 1.4
Revision: 1
Description: File archive/compression utility
DescDetail: <<
	nomarch lists/extracts/tests `.arc' archives. (It also handles `.ark'
	files, they're exactly the same.) This is a *very* outdated file format
	which should never be used for anything new, but unfortunately, you can
	still run into it every so often (especially if you mess about with old
	CP/M stuff). So nomarch is handy as a way to deal with these files.

	For more on how nomarch works and how to use it, do `man nomarch' once
	it's installed.
