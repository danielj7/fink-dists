Description: Tool for distributing files
DescDetail: <<
 BitTorrent is a tool for distributing files. It's extremely easy to use -
 downloads are started by clicking on hyperlinks. Whenever more than one person
 is downloading at once they send pieces of the file(s) to each other, thus
 relieving the central server's bandwidth burden. Even with many simultaneous
 downloads, the upload burden on the central server remains quite small, since
 each new downloader introduces new upload capacity.
 This version has the X11 front-end disabled. For the version with X11 support,
 see 'bittorrent'.
