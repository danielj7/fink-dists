DescDetail: <<
libEMF is a library for generating Enhanced Metafiles on systems which
don't natively support the ECMA-234 Graphics Device Interface
(GDI). The library is intended to be used as a driver for other
graphics programs such as Grace or gnuplot. Therefore, it implements a
very limited subset of the GDI.
