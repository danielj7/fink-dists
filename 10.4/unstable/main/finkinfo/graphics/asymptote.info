Description: Script-based vector graphics language
DescDetail: << 
 Asymptote is a powerful script-based vector graphics language for technical
 drawings, inspired by MetaPost but with an improved C++-like
 syntax. Asymptote provides for figures the same high-quality level of
 typesetting that LaTeX does for scientific text.
<<
DescUsage: <<
 The GUI "xasy" is a Python script. 
 It runs with whatever "python" executable comes first in your PATH. 
 It works both with the system python (using aqua graphics, 
 better-looking but not-quite functional) and with Fink's python 
 (using X11 graphics, ugly but better-working). 
 So you can choose which one you want to 
 use, by either manipulating your PATH, for example running
 
   env PATH=/usr/bin:$PATH xasy
 
 for aqua graphics, 
 or by simply installing or uninstalling Fink's "python" package.  
<<
DescPort: <<
 This version uses the system OpenGL and GLUT frameworks for 3D effects.
 It also uses the movie15 latex style.

 The xasy python script now crashes if it does not find the PIL library. 
 We depend therefore on pil-systempython25. This seems to work with both
 the system python and Fink's python2.5 and python2.6.
