Package: xpostit
Version: 3.3.2
Revision: 1
Description: X window system Post-it(R) notes
DescPort: <<
There is a plaid.c (functions) and a Plaid.c (the Plaid widget), so
plaid.c is renamed to plaidfuncs.c (and associated Imakefile change).
Some #include and prototype tweaking was required to get it to compile
and run.  There are still a lot of compiler warnings, but nothing
show-stopping.

The current Debian distro uses 3.3.1 even though older distros use
3.3.2.  The original-source URL given in the debian 3.3.2-2 package is
no longer valid, so we fetch the older debian (=newer xpostit) package
and rename the tarball on-the-fly so we don't confuse the debian and
fink packaging revision-numbers.

Thanks to Jeffrey Whitaker's gv-3.5.8-5.info and Sylvain Cuaz's
xblast-2.6.1-2.info for tips on getting the xmkmf-provided 'make
install' to work under Fink. The commented-out InstallScript was my
best prospect at getting it all correct, but even that one insisted on
creating /sw/lib/app-defaults as a copy of the /sw/etc one (but
putting its xdefaults in /the /sw/etc one). But gv also does this, so
installing xpostit after gv fails as dpkg refuses to let xpostit over-
write gv's /sw/etc/app-defaults.
