DescPackaging: <<
This package:

The license is listed as GPL2+/Public Domain, and the validator doesn't currently
handle that.


Common for all octave-forge packages:

We read in postinst and prerm template scripts installed by octaveN and modify
them to use the name of this package because Octave's package manager can't 
cope with non-literal arguments.

The Type: forge (pkgname) is used to minimize what needs to be changed when
using this .info file as a template.
