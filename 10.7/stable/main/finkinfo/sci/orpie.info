DescDetail: <<
Orpie is a fullscreen RPN calculator for the console.  Its operation is 
similar to that of modern HP calculators, but data entry has been 
optimized for efficiency on a PC keyboard.  Features include extensive 
scientific calculator functionality, command completion, and a visible 
interactive stack.
