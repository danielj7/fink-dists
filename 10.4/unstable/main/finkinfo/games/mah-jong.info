DescDetail: <<
This is a set of three programs which provide a networked Mah Jong program, 
together with a computer player. Thus the game can be played by four humans, 
by a human and three computer players, or any other combination. There is a 
server program, which handles the game - only one game, since I'm not trying 
to compete with Yahoo! and friends -, an X client to allow humans to play 
naturally, and a computer player. The version of Mah Jong is that generally 
called Chinese Classical.

DescUsage: <<

computer and network players.
