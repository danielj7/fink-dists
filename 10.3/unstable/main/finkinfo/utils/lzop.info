Description: Real-time compressor
DescDetail: <<
lzop is a file compressor which is very similar to gzip. lzop uses the LZO
data compression library for compression services, and its main advantages
over gzip are much higher compression and decompression speed (at the cost
of some compression ratio).

 This is technically 1.02rc1: homepage says:
   As of Oct 2006 there has not been any problem report, and 1.02rc1
   will get released as official version 1.02 whenever I find some
   spare time.
 But has not done so, so we'll just call it 1.02 for the fink world.
