Description: Lightweight scripting for Java
DescDetail: <<
BeanShell is a small, free, embeddable Java source interpreter with object
scripting language features, written in Java. BeanShell dynamically executes
standard Java syntax and extends it with common scripting conveniences such as
loose types, commands, and method closures like those in Perl and JavaScript.

You can use BeanShell interactively for Java experimentation and debugging as
well as to extend your applications in new ways. Scripting Java lends itself to
a wide variety of applications including rapid prototyping, user scripting
extension, rules engines, configuration, testing, dynamic deployment, embedded
systems, and even Java education.

BeanShell is small and embeddable, so you can call BeanShell from your Java
applications to execute Java code dynamically at run-time or to provide
extensibility in your applications. Alternatively, you can use standalone
BeanShell scripts to manipulate Java applications; working with Java objects
and APIs dynamically. Since BeanShell is written in Java and runs in the same
VM as your application, you can freely pass references to "live" objects into
scripts and return them as results.

In short, BeanShell is dynamically interpreted Java, plus a scripting language
and flexible environment all rolled into one clean package.
