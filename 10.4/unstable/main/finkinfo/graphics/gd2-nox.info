  Description: Executables for gd2 package (no X11)

Description: Graphics generation library (no X11 support)
DescDetail: <<
 The GD library is useful for creating graphics like hit counters on
 the fly. This version supports the PNG, JPEG and WBMP formats and lets
 you use TrueType fonts rendered via freetype2.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
 This package is based on previous work by David Morrison, Chris Pepper, Jeremy Higgs
 and Peter O'Gorman.  Previously maintained by Christoph Pfisterer.

 BuildDepends on autoconf is needed for 10.3, not for 10.4 (but is present
 in both packages for ease of maintenance).
 
 The -nox version installs only static libraries, for use by other programs
 which need gd2 functionality in a -nox environment.
