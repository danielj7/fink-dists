Description: Kaptain grammars for EMBOSS
DescPackaging: <<
Instead of patching the original install.sh file, I moved the
installation script into the InstallScript field. This way I can use the
percent expansion paths, which were not recognized by the patched
install-script.

Depends on emboss, which doesn't compile on intel
<<
DescDetail: <<
EMBOSS.kaptn is a graphical user interface for (up to now) 180 programs
of the EMBOSS sequence analysis package. It uses Kaptain, a universal
front-end for command line applications. EMBOSS is a collection of
high-quality free Open Source software for sequence analysis. With
EMBOSS.kaptn it integrates nicely into X window based desktops like KDE
or Gnome on unix or linux systems, as long as the QT libraries are
installed.
<<
DescUsage: <<
Either start the grammars from the command line in an X Window
environment, or, if you have KDE installed, from the K-Menu.
