Description: MiKTeX package manager tools 
DescDetail: << 
  The MiKTeX Tools package does not comprise a TeX system.
  The package should be regarded as an addition to the TeX system
  installed on your system.

  The following utilities are included:
  - initexmf: MiKTeX Configuration Utility
  - mpm: MiKTeX Package Manager
  - mthelp: MiKTeX Help Utility (experimental)
<<
DescUsage: <<
 By default, mpm installs its packages into %p/share/texmf-local
 or wherever the TeX environment variable $TEXMFLOCAL points to.
 You can determine this directory with the shell command
     kpsewhich --expand-var '$TEXMFLOCAL'
 You can override the default by using the option 
  --install-root with the mpm command.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
 BuildDependsOnly: False, because some private headers are included.
 The dylibs are purely local, so no shlibs splitoff is needed.
<<
DescPort: <<
 The LIBCURL_CPPFLAGS configure hack prevents %p/include to appear
 too early on the compiler line.
