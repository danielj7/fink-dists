Description: X/Kedit-like scriptable text/program editor   
DescDetail: <<
  This package makes Mark Hessling's THE, a unix implementation of IBM's
VM/CMS Xedit and Kedit for the DOS platform, available to the Mac OS X
platform.  The includes powerful folding and scripting features,
allowing users to do a search and replace, for example,  only on lines
previously selected by other criteria.  (Try for example the 'all
/criteria/' command followed by 'c /target/replace/ *')  Also try using
the shadow selection prefix and line commands.  All of this is fully
scriptable using the Rexx macro language, a powerful tcl-like
programming language (Rexx is made available via fink as the regina
package.)
   The fink package of 'the' installs two binary executables, one built to
run in X11 ('the-xcurses') and one built to run in any terminal window,
most notably Apple's  ('the-ncurses'). Invoking 'the' from the command
line will invoke whichever of these two versions that seems most
appropriate to the terminal type.  The fink package also installs a
default user profile in ~/.therc and sets up a macro directory in
/sw/share/THE, provided the profile file does not already exist.
Full documentation of the editor and its many commands is available at
http://hessling-editor.sourceforge.net/doc/index.html. Some online help
is available within the by issuing the 'help' command from the
command/home line, or by typing shift-F4 under the default profile.
   Many thanks for this package are due to Mathias Meyer, who made it
possible.
