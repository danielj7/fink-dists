Description: Diagnostic logging handlers
DescDetail: <<
    This module enables you to do generic message logging throughout
    programs and projects. Every message will be logged with
    stacktraces, timestamps and so on. You can use built-in handlers
    immediately, or after the fact when you inspect the error stack.
    It is highly configurable and let's you even provide your own
    handlers for dealing with messages.
