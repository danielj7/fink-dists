DescDetail: <<
The latest open-source implementation of XSLT 2.0 and XPath 2.0, and XQuery
1.0. This provides the "basic" conformance level of these languages: in effect,
this provides all the features of the languages except schema-aware processing.
This version reflects the syntax of the XSLT 2.0, XQuery 1.0, and XPath 2.0
Candidate Recommendations of 8 June 2006.
<<

DescPackaging: <<
SAXON works straight out of the box. The only thing I've added is a
small shell script wrapper to provide a "saxon" shell command. The packaging
is based on Nigel Stanger's original 6.5.3 version for Saxon.
<<

DescUsage: <<
Type saxon without any arguments for help (the -? command line switch
is supposed to do this, but seems to get tangled up with tcsh's
filename globbing or something). Full HTML documentation is also
available.
