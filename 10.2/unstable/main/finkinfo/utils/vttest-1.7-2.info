Description: VT100/VT220/XTerm test utility
DescDetail: <<
 This is a program to test the compatibility (or to demonstrate the
 non-compatibility) of so-called "VT100-compatible" terminals. In
 conformance of the good old hacker traditions, the only documentation
 of this program is the source code itself. To understand it, you also
 need a copy of the original VT100 manual from DEC.

 Additional tests (past version 1.7) are provided for analysis of
 vt220, vt420 terminals, as well as variants of xterm.

DescPort: Use -prebind as this program links only against Apple-supplied dylibs.
