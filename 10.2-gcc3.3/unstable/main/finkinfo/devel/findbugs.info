DescDetail: <<
FindBugs is a program to find bugs in Java programs.  It looks for
instances of "bug patterns" --- code instances that are likely to be
errors.

Changes since version 0.7.2:

  * Enhanced Eclipse plugin, which displays the detailed bug
    description in a view (Phil Crosby)
  * Various tweaks to existing detectors to reduce false warnings
  * New command line option -workHard enables pruning of infeasible or
    unlikely exception edges, which results in better accuracy in the
    open stream detector, at the expense of a 30%-100% slowdown
  * New website and HTML documentation design Documentation includes
    an HTML document with descriptions of all bug patterns reported by
    FindBugs
  * Web page has a link to a Japanese translation of the FindBugs
    manual, contributed by Hiroshi Okugawa
  * Changed the Inconsistent Synchronization detector so that fields
    synchronized 50% of the time (or more) are reported as medium
    priority bugs (previously they were reported as low)
  * New detector to find code that catches
    IllegalMonitorStateException
  * New detector to find private methods that are never called
  * New detector to find suspicious uses of non-short-circuiting
    boolean operators (& and |, rather than && and ||)

Findbugs itself is release under the LGPL, however the shell scripts that
launch the program contain some code subject to the Apache Software
License.

This is why I've set the License field to OSI-Approved
