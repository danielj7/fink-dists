DescPackaging: <<
	No clue if interface is at all stable...upstream doesn't
	version it, so assume it drifts arbitrarily with each %v

	makefile spaghetti puts global flags for external support libs
	before ones in local source dirs, hard to fix Right, so just
	hack to pass local first in an autoconf variable (to which
	makefiles append) and then edit it back out of the intalled
	config files.

	Check whether _THREAD_SAFE is already defined (which it often
	is) before #defining it...silences a ton of warnings about
	redefining a token.

	pssl.cxx d2i_DHparams_bio game is for openssl<0.9.8, not
	platform-dependent. Scrap it, use BuildDepends:openssl098-dev
	See: http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=574992

	Gotta define the LIB_FILENAME before basing the soname and
	installation targets on it.
<<
DescPort: <<
	Makefile.in patched to use same filename patterns that were
	built, based on MacPorts bug-report & patch:
	https://trac.macports.org/attachment/ticket/16465/patch-Makefile.in.diff

	Also add -install_name to lib.mak to get a public shared lib
	that can be linked against even after build dir is deleted.
	Also add -compatibility_version to the half-implemented darwin
	support.

Description: Cross-platform appplication library
DescDetail: <<
PTLib (Portable Tools Library) is a moderately large class library
that has it's genesis many years ago as PWLib (portable Windows
Library), a method to product applications to run on both Microsoft
Windows and Unix systems. It has also been ported to other systems
such as Mac OSX, VxWorks and other embedded systems

Since then the system has grown to include many classes that assist in
writing complete multi-platform applications. Classes for I/O
portability, multi- threading portability, aid in producing unix
daemons and NT services portably and all sorts of internet protocols
were added over the years. So it became a Portable Tools Library and
was renamed to PTLib.
