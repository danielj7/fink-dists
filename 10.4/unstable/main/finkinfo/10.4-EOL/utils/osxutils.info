Description: Mac-specific command-line file utilities
DescDetail: <<
 osxutils is a package of potentially useful Mac-oriented command-line
 utilities for Mac OS X. These tools represent an effort to bring command-line
 control over certain aspects of the Mac OS, particularly file meta-data such
 as Finder flags, heritage file Type and Creator codes, icons, comments, labels
 and suffixes / file extensions.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
	- Fix 64-bit compilation.
	- Completely rewrite 'trash' so it doesn't produce filenames like
		'foo copy 1 copy 1 copy 1'.
	- Getting OS 9 comments doesn't seem to work on 10.5 and higher, so make
		it just print a warning.
	- The wsupdate command is probably unnecessary on 10.4 and higher, since
		the Finder now watches for directory update notifications. But
		perhaps there's still some situation in which it's useful, so keep
		it around.
	- Use update-alternatives to resolve conflict with surfraw.
	
	Previous version maintained by Carsten Klapp.
