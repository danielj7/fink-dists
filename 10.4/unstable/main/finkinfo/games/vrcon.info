DescPort: <<
- Use Fink's ncurses instead of 10.4's included libncurses.
- Finally compiles with prebinding on 10.4, thanks to:
  http://svn.python.org/view?rev=36039&view=rev
  (Without SetMACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET: 10.3 it compiles fine on 10.4
  but without prebinding.)
- Probably compiles just fine on any Mac OS X/Darwin, really only
  requires curses.
