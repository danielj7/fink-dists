Description: Perl interface to the NIST Secure Hash Algorithm
DescDetail: <<
 The Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA) was developed by NIST and is specified
 in the Secure Hash Standard (SHS, FIPS 180). SHA-1 is a revision to
 this version and was published in 1994. It is also described in the
 ANSI X9.30 (part 2) standard. SHA-1 produces a 160-bit (20 byte)
 message digest. Although slower than MD5, this larger digest size
 makes it stronger against brute force attacks.
