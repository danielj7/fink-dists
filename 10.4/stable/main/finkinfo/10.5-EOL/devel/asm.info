Description: Java bytecode manipulation framework
DescDetail: <<
ASM is a Java bytecode manipulation framework. It can be used to dynamically
generate stub classes or other proxy classes, directly in binary form, or to
dynamically modify classes at load time, i.e., just before they are loaded into
the Java Virtual Machine.

ASM offers similar functionalities as BCEL or SERP, but is much smaller (33KB
instead of 350KB for BCEL and 150KB for SERP) and faster than these tools (the
overhead of a load time class transformation is of the order of 60% with ASM,
700% or more with BCEL, and 1100% or more with SERP). Indeed ASM was designed
to be used in a dynamic way* and was therefore designed and implemented to be
as small and as fast as possible.

(*) ASM can of course be used in a static way too.
