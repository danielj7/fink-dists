DescDetail: <<
The FCAT tool is used for the Coverage Analysis of FORTRAN codes.
This includes

   - finding out "cold-spot" in Fortran codes (the part of 
     the codes that are never executed), and flags these
     parts line-by-line.
      

   - finding out "hot-spot" in Fortran codes (the part of 
     the codes that are most frequently executed), and gives
     a line by line profile.

It is designed to working mainly with F90/F95, even through it can
also work with fixed formatted FORTRAN, thus F77.
