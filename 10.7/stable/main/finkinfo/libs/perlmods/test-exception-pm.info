This module provides a few convenience methods for testing exception
based code. It is built with Test::Builder and plays happily with
Test::More and friends.

If you are not already familiar with Test::More now would be the time to
go take a look.

You can specify the test plan when you "use Test::Exception" in the same
way as "use Test::More". See Test::More for details.
