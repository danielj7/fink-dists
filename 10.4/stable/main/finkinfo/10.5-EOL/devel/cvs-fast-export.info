Revision: 1
Description: Export CVS to fast-import stream
DescDetail: <<
Export an RCS or CVS history as a fast-import stream. This program
analyzes a collection of RCS files in a CVS repository (or outside of
one) and, when possible, emits an equivalent history in the form of a
fast-import stream. Not all possible histories can be rendered this way;
the program tries to emit useful warnings when it can't. The program can
also produce a visualization of the resulting commit DAG in the DOT
format handled by the graphviz suite.
