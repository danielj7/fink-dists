Description: Puzzle game
DescDetail: <<
  Pushover is a fun puzzle game originally published by Ocean in 1992. In this
  game you control an ant that can walk along platforms that are connected
  with ladders. On those platforms are dominos that need to fall according to
  some rules.
  All dominos must fall and none must crash into another
  One special domino must fall as last domino and that domino triggers the exit
  door to open when you enter the exit door the level has been completed
  You may rearrange as many dominos as you want, except for the trigger. You
  may not place dominos in front of the doors, except for the vanishing domino
  You may push push once to start a chain reaction with the dominos leading to
  the fall of all of them.
  All this has to be done within a time limit (which is normally generous).
  There are 10 different dominos that behave differently when pushed, some 
  fall, some not, some wait a bit before they fall, some raise, some toppler until 
  they meet an obstacle.
  There is a help in the game and introductory levels that show how all the
  dominos work.
