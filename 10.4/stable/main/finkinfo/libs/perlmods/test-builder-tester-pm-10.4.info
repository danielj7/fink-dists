Test::Builder::Tester was absorbed into test-simple. This package is
provided for compatibility/upgrading to continue to provide that
module via the test-simple-pmXXX for the system-perl version on OS X
10.4.

DescPackaging: <<
	Former maintainer: Blair Zajac <blair@orcaware.com>

	We do not use the technical "obsolete" designation because
	that would make all dependants want to upgrade their
	dependencies to test-simple-pmXXX, which is perl-version
	varianted whereas the old test-builder-tester-pm was not. No
	need to make them suddenly become perl-version varianted or
	have to make Distribution-specific module for each different
	system-perl version.
