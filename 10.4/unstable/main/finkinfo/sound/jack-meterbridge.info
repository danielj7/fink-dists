Supported meters

PPM - Peak Program level Meters

Approximatly conforming to BS 6840-10. These meters are designed to
indicate peak amplitude, as opposed to VU meters which are designed to
indicate volume.

The scale is correct according to the standard, 4 equates to 0dB, 1 to
-12, 7 to +12, and it is linear with decibels.

I've never used a real PPM meter, so I don't know if it reacts
correctly. Feedback welcome.

	
VU - Volume Unit meters

Conforming to BS 6840-17:1991. Real meter is larger.

These meters are designed to measure the "volume" of an audio signal,
it is not as relevant to digital systems as PPM meters, but is useful
if you are interfacing to analogue tape, FM broadcast equipment or
want a general idea of the signal volume.

The -r flag (set reference level) is usful with these meters as it
will allow you to calibrate to your DA converters. The meter is
pre-adjusted so that it should allign correctly calibrated DA
converters with analogue systems. If you wish to run with 0dBFS = 0dBu
then use "-r 20"

DPM - Digital Peak Meter

Conforming to IEC 268-18:1995 (peak indiciator decay may not be correct).

These are meters as typically seen on digital consoles, HD recorders etc.

There are the most efficient in screen realestate and CPU use but look
a bit boring ;)

	
JF - "Jellyfish" Meter (aka. Goniometer)

A jellyfish meter is a stereo scope display, it can be used to spot
phase and mono compatibility problems.

Some charateristic problems can be seen, eg. a signal with a stronger
left channel is seen as a shape sloping to the left [\], more right
slopes to the right [/], and dead mono is a vertical line [|].

The meter below the scope display indicates the degree of stereo
correlation between the channels, a value of +1 means that it is
perfectly mono compatible, and -1 and that the channels are in
anti-phase (so they will cancel out if mixed).

If someone has better examples, please mail them to me, there are
probably tutorials online.

SCO - Scope

A rendering of an oscilloscope display.

It has a basic trigger function, but there is no timebase control. It
renders one pixel per sample, so it will probably be next to useless
at 96KHz
