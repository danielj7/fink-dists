DescDetail: <<
An R software package on statistical tests widely utilized in
biostatistics, public policy and law. Along with the well known
tests for equality of means and variances, randomness, measures
of relative variability etc, the package contains new robust
tests of symmetry, omnibus and directional tests of normality,
and their graphical counterparts such as Robust QQ plot; a
robust trend tests for variances etc. All implemented tests and
methods are illustrated by simulations and real-life examples
from legal statistics, economics, and biostatistics.
