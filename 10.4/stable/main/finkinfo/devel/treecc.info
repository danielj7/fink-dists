Description: Tree Compiler-Compiler
DescDetail: <<
Treecc is designed to assist in the development of compilers and other 
language-based tools. It manages the generation of code to handle abstract 
syntax trees and operations upon the trees.
The C# compiler in Portable.NET is built on top of treecc.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
The .info file is messed up, so it isn't listed in InfoDocs.

Included autotools are so old they don't know to build the actual
program target! Redo from scratch.
