Description: The C* Audio Plugin Suite
License: GPL

DescDetail: <<

CAPS, the C* Audio Plugin Suite, is a collection of refined LADSPA
audio plugins capable of (and mainly intended for) realtime
operation. The suite includes DSP units emulating instrument
amplifiers, stomp-box classics, versatile 'virtual analogue'
oscillators, fractal oscillation, reverb, equalization and more.

My favourite user's quote: "... if your amps beat your plugins, they
are *very good* amps.. ;-)" - Thanks, Pete!

Most of the suite is of my own invention, while some plugins are
rewrites of existing designs, included for excellence or
interest. Inspiring code was authored by (in no particular order):
Andrew Simper, Perry Cook, Gary Scavone, Steve Harris, Richard Dobson,
Bram de Jong, Robert Bristow-Johnson and others.

The ToneStack plugins and the tone controls of the AmpVTS unit have
been designed and implemented by David Yeh at CCRMA.

All of CAPS is free software and distributed in source code.
