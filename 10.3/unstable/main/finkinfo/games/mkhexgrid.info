DescDetail: <<
 mkhexgrid is a small command-line program which generates 
 hexagonal grids of the sort used for strategy games. Hex 
 grids can be created as PNG or SVG images, and as 
 PostScript. Virtually every aspect of the output can be 
 adjusted, from grid line thickness and color, to style 
 and size of hex centers, to the style and position of hex 
 coordinates. mkhexgrid makes it simple to create whatever 
 hex grid you need.
