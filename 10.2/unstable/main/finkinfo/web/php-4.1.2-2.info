Description: HTML-embedded server-side scripting language
DescDetail: <<
PHP is a scripting language that can be embedded into HTML pages. Like
with CGI scripts, the code is evaluated on the server side (like a CGI
script), allowing you to generate content dynamically. PHP is
implemented as a loadable module for the Apache web server.

PHP has interfaces to almost any database, library and API that you
can think of.
<<
DescUsage: <<
You must add an appropriate LoadModule line to httpd.conf and enable
the handlers for the extensions you want to use (there are examples
for .php in httpd.conf). An example for the LoadModule line:

 LoadModule php4_module lib/apache/1.3/libphp4.so

Additionally, either add an AddModule line or comment out the whole
AddModule section.
