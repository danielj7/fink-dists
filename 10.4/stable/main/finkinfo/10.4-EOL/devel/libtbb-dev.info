Description: Threading Building Blocks
DescDetail: <<
    Threading Building Blocks (TBB) is an award-winning C++ runtime library
    that abstracts the low-level threading details necessary for optimal
    multi-core performance. It uses common C++ templates and coding style to
    eliminate tedious threading implementation work.

    TBB requires fewer lines of code to achieve parallelism than other
    threading models. The applications you write are portable across platforms.
    Since the library is also inherently scalable, no code maintenance is
    required as more processor cores become available.
