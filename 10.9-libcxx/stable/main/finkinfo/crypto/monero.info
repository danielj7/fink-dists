Description: Secure, private, untraceable cryptocurrency
DescDetail: <<
Monero is a private, secure, untraceable, decentralised digital
currency. You are your bank, you control your funds, and nobody can
trace your transfers unless you allow them to do so.

Privacy: Monero uses a cryptographically sound system to allow you to
send and receive funds without your transactions being easily revealed
on the blockchain (the ledger of transactions that everyone has). This
ensures that your purchases, receipts, and all transfers remain
absolutely private by default.

Security: Using the power of a distributed peer-to-peer consensus
network, every transaction on the network is cryptographically
secured. Individual wallets have a 25 word mnemonic seed that is only
displayed once, and can be written down to backup the wallet. Wallet
files are encrypted with a passphrase to ensure they are useless if
stolen.

Untraceability: By taking advantage of ring signatures, a special
property of a certain type of cryptography, Monero is able to ensure
that transactions are not only untraceable, but have an optional
measure of ambiguity that ensures that transactions cannot easily be
tied back to an individual user or computer.
