Description: Afterstep XVT - a VT102 emulator
DescDetail: <<
Aterm is a colour vt102 terminal emulator, based on rxvt 2.4.8 with some
additions of fast transparency, intended as an xterm replacement for users
who do not require features such as Tektronix 4014 emulation and
toolkit-style configurability. As a result, aterm uses much less swap space
-- a significant advantage on a machine serving many X sessions. It was
created with AfterStep Window Manager users in mind, but is not tied to any
libraries, and can be used anywhere.
