Description: DEPRECATED -- use Wireshark instead
DescDetail: <<
It is strongly recommended that you use the 'wireshark-ssl'
package, which is the successor of ethereal, instead of this
one. Ethereal does not receive any security updates anymore.
Various serious security problems with ethereal have been
fixed in 'wireshark-ssl'.
