DescUsage: <<
imboot

Any package that BuildDepends on imboot also needs to BuildDepend
on x11 (or whatever package contains imake).
<<
DescDetail: <<
imboot is a general-purpose imake bootstrapper that can be used 
to select from among an arbitrary number of sets of configuration 
files. It can be used to avoiding having multiple bootstrappers 
around. It also can be used when you have an extensible 
configuration file architecture that allows you to used publicly-
installed configuration files whose contents can be selectively 
overridden with private files located within your project. imboot 
comes in sh or Perl versions.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
Only installs the sh version and not the Perl version.  Both are functionally equivalent.
<<
DescPort: <<
Does not use the imake/make compile described in README because it sends everything to /usr/X11R6.
