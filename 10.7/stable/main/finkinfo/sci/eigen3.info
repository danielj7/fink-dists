DescDetail: <<
Eigen 3 is a C++ template library for linear algebra (vectors, matrices, and 
related algorithms). It is:
 * Versatile. Eigen handles both fixed-size and dynamic-size matrices and
  vectors, without code duplication, and in a completely integrated way. It
  aims to provide not only vectors and matrices but also many algorithms.
 * Fast. Expression templates remove temporaries and enable lazy evaluation.
  Explicit vectorization is performed for the SSE (2 and later) and AltiVec
  instruction sets, with graceful fallback to non-vectorized code. With
  fixed-size objects, dynamic memory allocation is avoided, and the loops
  are unrolled when that makes sense. For large matrices, special attention
  is paid to cache-friendliness. This Benchmark shows Eigen's outstanding
 performance.
 * Good API. Expression templates allow for a very clean and expressive API.
  Implementing an algorithm on top of Eigen feels like just copying
  pseudocode.
