DescDetail: <<
Ledger is a command-line accounting tool for maintaing doubly-entry
ledgers.  The syntax for ledger files is simple (see the file
`sample.dat' in the `examples' subdirectory of the Ledger
documentation directory) and can be maintained using only a text
editor.  But it is not necessary to use a text editor to maintain
ledger files: it's possible to use the Gnucash package for this
purpose.

Several example python scripts for performing typical calculations are
included.  They can be found in the ledger documentation directory, in
the `extras' subdirectory.  Some of these scripts draw graphs using
the Gnuplot package.

An emacs package, `ledger.el', is also included.  To enable it, simply
add the command

  (require 'ledger)

in your emacs initialization file.
