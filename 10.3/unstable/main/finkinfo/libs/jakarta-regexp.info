Description: Java Regular Expression Parsing
DescDetail: <<
Regexp is a 100% Pure Java Regular Expression package that was graciously
donated to the Apache Software Foundation by Jonathan Locke.  He originally
wrote this software back in 1996 and it has stood up quite well to the
test of time.  It includes complete Javadoc documentation as well as a
simple Applet for visual debugging and testing suite for compatibility.
