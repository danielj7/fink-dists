Description: SNMP agent for PostgreSQL
DescDetail: <<
pgsnmpd is an SNMP agent for PostgreSQL which implements RDBMS-MIB, as
defined in RFC 1697.  This MIB was developed by a group of representatives
from different database manufacturers, and describes various attributes
common to most relational database management systems.  Because it was
designed as the least common denominator, it doesn't show very much detail
and there are definitely a number of things RDBMS-MIB doesn't cover that
PostgreSQL administrators would be very interested in.  Future versions of
pgsnmpd will support a second MIB, tentatively called PGSQL-MIB, in addition
to RDBMS-MIB.  This PGSQL-MIB will be PostgreSQL-specific, and will include
many more data points of interest to PostgreSQL users and administrators.
<<
DescUsage: <<
The best way to use pgsnmpd is to enable AgentX in your net-snmp (this
package is compatible both with the system net-snmp, and Fink's version)
by adding the following lines in your snmpd.conf:

	master  agentx
	agentXSocket tcp:localhost:705

Then, start pgsnmpd with the connection options to connect to your
PostgreSQL database instance:

	%p/sbin/pgsnmpd -s -C "dbname=template1 user=postgres"
