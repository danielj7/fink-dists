DescDetail: <<
	The RPM Package Manager (RPM) is a powerful command line driven package
	management system capable of installing, uninstalling, verifying, querying,
	and updating computer software packages. Each software package consists of
	an archive of files along with information about the package like its
	version, a description, and the like. There is also a related API
	("Application Program Interface"), permitting advanced developers to
	bypass 'shelling out' to a command line, and to manage such transactions
	from within a native coding language.

DescPackaging: <<
	The conf files installed are not real 'ConfFiles', since they should not be modified.
	Changes belong in %p/etc/rpmrc, etc. (Or maybe just /etc/rpmrc?)
