Description: Extension of Perforce Jam portable make replacement
DescDetail: <<
Boost.Jam (BJam) is a build tool based on FTJam, which in turn is 
based on Perforce Jam. It contains significant improvements made to 
facilitate its use in the Boost Build System, but should be backward 
compatible with Perforce Jam.
