Description:  Phylogeny and sequence data management package.
DescDetail: <<
The ARB software is a graphically oriented package comprising various tools for sequence 
database handling and data analysis. A central database of processed (aligned) sequences
and any type of additional data linked to the respective sequence entries is structured 
according to phylogeny or other user defined criteria.
<<
DescUsage: <<
ARB works, but the PT_server and "fast save" will NOT work on an HFS+ volume. 
The current fix is to specify your PT_server directory on a UFS disk. 
A UFS disk image can be used for this purpose.
The default dir is /sw/share/arb/lib/pts/ - symlink this to a writable UFS image.
Future revisions, this limitation can hopefully be patched around.
<<
DescPort: <<
ARB does NOT work with lesstif - many images do not display. Thus depends on openmotif.
Many patches. Shared libraries not building correctly, so i have them building static. 
It wants them in its own lib directory. See the patches to the Makefile. 
Thanks to Mike Dyall-Smith for the help in testing this.
