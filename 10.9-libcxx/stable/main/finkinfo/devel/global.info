DescDetail: <<

GNU GLOBAL is a source code tagging system that works the same way
across diverse environments, such as Emacs editor, Vi editor, Less
viewer, Bash shell, various web browsers, etc.

You can locate various objects, such as functions, macros, structs,
classes, in your source files and move there easily. It is useful for
hacking a large projects which contain many sub-directories, many
#ifdef and many main() functions. It is similar to ctags or etags, but
is different from them in the following two points:

  * independence of any editor
  * capability to treat definition and reference
