DescUsage: <<
%N is a dummy package: if you really used to need it, you should
Depends: %N-shlibs (>= 2.12.0-1) instead, which supplies all the
files that were previously in %N.
<<
Description: Handy library of utility functions
DescPort: <<
	glib2 provides etc/glib-2.0/charset.alias for darwin because there's
	no system-wide charset.alias.
	See also: http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=346816
	Can we figure out how to generate this (gettext-tools config.charset
	for host=darwin5?)or import it from an authoritative upstream source
	instead of dragging along a legacy file in %N.patch?

	Disable two tests that fail on OS X apparently due to deficiencies
	in OS X locale support.
	See: http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=333977

	check uses some C++ but it doesn't leak out into the installed
	package

	Patch child-test.c for our location of `true`. See:
	http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=495690

	We need to set LANG=C when doing 'make check', else a previously
	installed glib2 will trigger a crash caused by a bug in the old
	de.po. See http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=310731
	Need to figure out how to patch tests/Makefile to use the nascent
	gettext dictionaries in preference to installed ones.

	poll() is broken on 10.4 but not 10.3; force internal emulation
	to regardless of config result so that lib builds the same everywhere
	and is portable.

	Need to patch gutils.h for inline semantics of gcc on OS X >= 10.5.
	gcc version is not sufficient to determine it (appears to be xcode-
	specific patches to gcc), so test Apple gcc build number. See:
	http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=315437 (patch	#96366 does
	not work...not __GNUC_PREREQ). No idea a portable solution, but
	msachs says "static inline" is right for this case, so hardcode it.
	2.14.5 does it "differently" but still looks like the same wrong
	patch, so leaving our existing "static inline" hard-coding patch.

	Fix paths in glib-gettextize. See:
	http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=518309

	Fix glib/gslice.c and glib/giounix.c clobbering of errno.
	See: http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=554092
	(patches from comments #14 and #15)

	Safer -framework flag to avoid future munging in .la. See:
	http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=566994
	Flag is not passed at all via .la now, but okay because we
	don't have static libs and the shared libs get what they need
	via dyld.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
	Sometimes not all .pc files get created. I suspect this is due to a
	missing BuildDepends or missing files due to Installer.app breakage,
	but don't know what. So all .pc are listed explicitly in Files so
	that if any are not built, the pkg will not build. Better to crash
	and force a diagnosis than to build a wrong package silently, which
	could lead to pkgs that use these .pc to build incorrectly (possibly
	silently also).

	Library contains some C symbols whose real name looks like C++
	munges. This should not be construed to mean that glib2 is C++ nor
	that it needs to obey Fink C++ packaging rules. C++ is also
	used in some self-tests.

	Prior to 2.12.0-1, %N contained the gettext catalogs and the
	charset.alias file, which are used by the %N-shlibs files. Starting
	in 2.12.0-1, they are all now in the %N-shlibs package, and %N is a
	dummy for compatibility and upgrades.

	Builds with included pcre instead of external lib to avoid need to
	cascade deps on pcre packages

	gtester-report claims to require python >= 2.4, but it appears
	to run with 2.3. Adjust to allow that version so can use
	Apple's on OS X < 10.5 also (py2.5 comes with OS X 10.5). See:
	http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=553716

	The following are newly deprecated in glib2 2.18.1 since 2.14.6:
		g_assert_warning
		G_GNUC_FUNCTION
		G_GNUC_PRETTY_FUNCTION
	Undo their deprecations until we get other packages updated to
	avoid using these things.

	Leaving G_DISABLE_SINGLE_INCLUDES undefined in most places,
	though in the future it will become defined...

	Disable the FAM plugin for gio. Darwin doesn't have libfam.
	Fink has gamin, a third-party implementation available in
	fink, has a dependency on glib. Eventually package gio-fam
	separately to avoid circular dependency.

	libgio sometimes runs %p/bin/update-desktop-database from the
	desktop-file-utils package, but that program links against
	libglib. Leave it as %N-shlibs:Recommends:d-f-u to break the
	circular dependency. Ick. Required for self-test, so would
	need to build (but not test) glib2, then build d-f-u against
	it, then rebuild glib2 with testing enabled. Ick^2.
