Description: Simple analog clock for your X11 desktop
DescDetail: <<
As clocks go, Buici satisfies the basic need of representing the time
accurately and attractively. I wrote it when I began to use X as my primary
desktop environment and wanted to have a decent looking clock on my desktop. I
loathe digital clocks. This release has limited configurability.
<<
DescPort: <<
'echo -e' doesn't do what upstream expects on OS X.
