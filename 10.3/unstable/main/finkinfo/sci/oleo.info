Description: The GNU spreadsheet
DescDetail: <<
Oleo is the GNU spreadsheet, some features include;
 - Access to the statistics functions of the GSL (GNU Scientific Library)
 - Device independent graphics through GNU plotutils
 - Interface to CUPS to browse available printers
 - Database access (MySQL and DBF files)
 - SciPlot graphics
 - Can be run with motif or ncurses interface  
<<
DescUsage: <<
 To run oleo with a motif interface just type "oleo" at the command prompt
in an x environment. To run the ncurses interface just type "oleo -t" at
the command prompt.
 To enter information into a cell with the motif interface your caps lock
must be on.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
 Patch so the correct 'doc' directory is selected.

 Originally packaged by Matt Stephenson.

 dmacks: use libSystem for getopt instead of lib/; use libgettext3
 packages instead of intl/ and patch po/ for modern xgettext.

 Need to shim a mysql function that was removed from that lib long ago
 But much harder to shim the ./configure test than to forge its results...

 Make sure we don't find things that aren't in fink at this time but
 might be in the future.
