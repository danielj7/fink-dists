Description: Restriction Enzyme Database for EMBOSS

DescDetail: <<
The Restriction Enzyme data BASE is a collection of information about
restriction enzymes and related proteins. It contains published and
unpublished references, recognition and cleavage sites, isoschizomers,
commercial availability, methylation sensitivity, crystal and sequence
data. DNA methyltransferases, homing endonucleases, nicking enzymes,
specificity subunits and control proteins are also included. Most
recently, putative DNA methyltransferases and restriction enzymes, as
predicted from analysis of genomic sequences, are also listed. REBASE is
continuously updated and the web pages not dynamically generated are
refreshed on a nightly basis.

DescPort: <<
 Set Epoch to 1, because version number went from 999 to 000,
 instead of 1000.
