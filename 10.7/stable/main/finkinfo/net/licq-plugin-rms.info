DescDetail: <<
This package provides the means to manage Licq instant messaging sessions
remotely through a telnet connection. For obvious reasons, if you don't
need this plug-in, you probably shouldn't install it.
<<
DescUsage: <<
Type licq -h for commandline help.

Loading and running the plugin is simply a matter of adding a "-p rms"
to your Licq command line arguments.  Remember that if any plugins are
loaded from the command line then all plugins must be specified.  In other
words if you are using the qt4-gui plugin and also wish to start the rms
plugin, run:
licq [options] -p qt4-gui -p rms -- [ qt4-gui options ] -- [ rms options ]

The plugin uses a small configuration file (~/.licq/licq_rms.conf) 
which must be set up by hand.  A sample is included at

%p/share/doc/licq-plugin-rms/examples/licq_rms.conf

, and includes help on the various settings.
