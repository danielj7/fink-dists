DescDetail: <<
OpenVPN is a full-featured SSL VPN solution which can accomodate a wide range
of configurations, including remote access, site-to-site VPNs, WiFi security,
and enterprise-scale remote access solutions with load balancing, failover, and
fine-grained access-controls.

OpenVPN implements OSI layer 2 or 3 secure network extension using the industry
standard SSL/TLS protocol, supports flexible client authentication methods
based on certificates, smart cards, and/or 2-factor authentication, and allows
user or group-specific access control policies using firewall rules applied to
the VPN virtual interface. OpenVPN is not a web application proxy and does not
operate through a web browser.
