Description: Efficient, lightweight, and secure ftp server
DescDetail: <<
Pure FTP Server is a fast, production quality, standards-conformant FTP
server based on Troll-FTPd. It has no known buffer overflows, is trivial
to set up, and is especially designed for modern kernels. Features include
PAM support, IPv6, chroot()ed home directories, virtual domains, built-in
'ls', FXP protocol, anti-warez system, bandwidth throttling, bounded ports
for passive downloads, an LDAP backend, XML output, and more.

DescUsage: <<
To configure pure-ftpd you can run it manually with '/sw/sbin/pureftpd &'
as root with a number of command line  options. You can also set it up to
run as a daemon by running 'sudo daemonic enable pure-ftpd' and disable it
with 'sudo daemonic disable pure-ftpd'.

Alternatively, you can modify the xinetd settings for FTP to use pure-ftpd
instead of Apple's ftpd by editing /etc/xinetd.d/ftp appropriately. This way,
when you enabled FTP in the System Preferences, it will be used automatically.
