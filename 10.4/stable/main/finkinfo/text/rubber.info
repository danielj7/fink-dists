Description: Building system for LaTeX documents
DescDetail: <<
This is a building system for LaTeX documents. It is based on a routine that
runs (hopefully) just as many compilations as necessary. The module system
provides a great flexibility that virtually allows support for any package with
no user intervention, as well as pre- and post-processing of the document. The
standard modules currently provide support for bibtex, dvips, pdftex,
makeindex, cweb and graphics/graphicx (currently with automatic epstopdf and
XFig picture conversion and Metapost compilation).
<<
DescUsage: <<
This package can be used with non-Fink TeX distributions, so a dependency isn't
specified.  If you want to use a Fink TeX distribution, you'll need to install
it yourself.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
Only uses python for scripting, so just use the system's version to save user
headaches.

Doesn't explicitly encode paths to executables (e.g. 'latex'), but just uses
the first in the PATH, so we'll avoid declaring a dependency and let users 
install one themselves.

We manually regenerate the .pyc files to avoid hardcoding %i in them.
