Description: Object wrappers for client/server apps
DescDetail: <<
ASSA is a general-purpose object-oriented collection of wrappers around
various UNIX C library functions and data structures designed to help with
the development of network-based client- and server-side applications.

The library consists of a simplistic implementation of the set of 
communication patterns such as Service Configurator, Reactor, Acceptor, 
Connector, and others described in various papers published by 
Dr. D. C. Schmidt. 

The full description can be found in "Pattern Languages of Program Design", 
Vol. 2 and 3 (Software Patterns Series), Addison Wesley
<<
DescPackaging: <<
	Lots of warnings, especially signed/unsigned comparisons.
	Leaving it alone for now.
<<
DescPort: <<
	Adjust #include to get ioctl() and friends for Socket.cpp

	Use BSDish SIG* symbols in Handlers.h, GenServer.cpp
  
	Remove un-needed -static linker flags and don't nuke global
	compiler flags in {tests,utils}/Makefile.in
