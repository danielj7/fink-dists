DescDetail: <<
A module that helps you test testing modules that are built with
Test::Builder.

The testing system is designed to be used by performing a three step
process for each test you wish to test.  This process starts with
using "test_out" and "test_err" in advance to declare what the
testsuite you are testing will output with Test::Builder to stdout and
stderr.

You then can run the test(s) from your test suite that call
Test::Builder.  At this point the output of Test::Builder is safely
captured by Test::Builder::Tester rather than being interpreted as
real test output.

The final stage is to call "test_test" that will simply compare what
you predeclared to what Test::Builder actually outputted, and report
the results back with a "ok" or "not ok" (with debugging) to the
normal output.
