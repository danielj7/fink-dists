Description: Binding for the libxml2 and libxslt
DescDetail: <<
The C libraries libxml2 and libxslt have huge benefits:

    * Standards-compliant XML support.
    * Full-featured.  (e.g. supports XPath)
    * Actively maintained by XML experts.
    * fast

lxml is a new Python binding for libxml2 and libxslt, completely
independent from these existing Python bindings. Its aim:

    * Pythonic API.
    * Documented.
    * Use Python unicode strings in API.
    * Safe (no segfaults).
    * No manual memory management!

lxml aims to provide a Pythonic API by following as much as possible
the ElementTree API. We're trying to avoid having to invent too many
new APIs, or you having to learn new things -- XML is complicated
enough.
