Description: MiKTeX package manager tools 
DescDetail: << 
  The MiKTeX Tools package does not comprise a TeX system.
  The package should be regarded as an addition to the TeX system
  installed on your system.

  The following utilities are included:
  - initexmf: MiKTeX Configuration Utility
  - mpm: MiKTeX Package Manager
  - mthelp: MiKTeX Help Utility (experimental)

  If you get any errors that say "locale name not valid", set your LANG to 'C'
  like this: $ LANG=C mpm --version
  This will fix the problem.
<<
DescUsage: <<
 By default, mpm installs its packages into %p/share/texmf-local
 or wherever the TeX environment variable $TEXMFLOCAL points to.
 You can determine this directory with the shell command
     kpsewhich --expand-var '$TEXMFLOCAL'
 You can override the default by using the option 
  --install-root with the mpm command.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
 BuildDependsOnly: False, because some private headers are included.
 The dylibs are purely local, so no shlibs splitoff is needed.
 Since somewhere between 2.6 and 2.8, the tools package was merged with the
 original package, so since version 2.8-3541 this package downloads all of
 miktex (but only compiles miktex-tools). The cmake script makes sure only
 miktex-tools is built on non-win32.

 About the patch:
 lynx is required by the cmake file, but we remove it, because it doesn't
 seem to be required here. Also, malloc.h inclusions are removed as MacOS
 doesn't have it (malloc is in stdlib.h), and the 64-bit function wrappers
 will simply use the native functions in Mac standard C library as they are
 64-bit by themselves.
<<
DescPort: <<
 The LIBCURL_CPPFLAGS configure hack prevents %p/include to appear
 too early on the compiler line.
