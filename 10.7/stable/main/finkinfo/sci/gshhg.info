Description: Global dataset of shorelines, rivers, borders
DescDetail: <<
 This package provides five different resolution versions of the GSHHG
 (Global Self-consistent Hierarchical High-resolution Geography)
 data base: course, low, intermediate, high, and full resolution.
 GSHHG combines the World Vector Shoreline and World Data Base II
 products into a single quality-checked hierarchical data base at
 5 resolutions.

 Although these shorelines are distributed as part of the Generic Mapping
 Tools (GMT), they can be used stand-alone or with other applications
 that can read NetCDF files. This version required at least netCDF
 version 4.
