Description: T-Coffee Multiple Sequence Alignment Program
DescDetail: <<
T-Coffee computes multiple sequence alignments for protein or dna/rna
sequences. It is considerably slower than ClustalW but does a better
job aligning more distantly related sequences (<30% identity).  There
are also some enhancements for cDNA alignments.
Previous maintainer: Jason Stajich

 cp -R %p/share/%n/t_coffee/ ~/.t_coffee
 sudo chown -R <your_username> ~/.t_coffee/
 
 T-coffee can be started by the command t_coffee.
