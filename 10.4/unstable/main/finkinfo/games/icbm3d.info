Description: "Inter-Continental Ballistic Missiles, 3D" - 3D game of defense
DescDetail: <<
	Like the original "Missile Command" and its clones, this game
	places  you  in  control  of  Anti-ICBM weapons which you use to
	destroy  an  onslaught of missiles (and other nasties) which are
	dropping onto your nation.
	The game ends when your cities have all  been  destroyed. You
	only   gain   replacement   cities  by  achieving  certain score
	thresholds during each attack (level).
	The main difference between this game and  Missile Command is
	that ICBM3D, as the name  suggests,  provides  a 3D perspective.
	You take advantage of X-Window's  3-button mouse to control your
	firing  sight  ("cross-hair")  in  3-dimensions, and change your
	viewpoint.
