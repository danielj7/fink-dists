Package: mathomatic
Version: 15.1.3
Revision: 1
Description: Symbolic algebra program
DescDetail: <<
Mathomatic is a small, portable symbolic math program that can
automatically solve, simplify, differentiate, combine, and compare
algebraic equations, perform polynomial and complex arithmetic, etc.
<<
DescPort: <<
Compile with readline support for generic Unix.

This thing is very noisy under -Wall: lots of implicit forward
function declarations and forgetting to declare void function return
types. Ain't gonna fix it.

CompileScript: <<
  make prefix=%p READLINE=1
  make test

InstallScript: <<
  make install prefix=%i mandir=%i/share/man

DescPackaging: <<
	makefile does not understand temp packaging dirs, so disable
	message that tells users the install dir is the runtime
	location.

	m4 wrapper not installed (will need to hack to distinguish
	runtime from installation locations).

	fink on 64-bit automatically does 64-bit correctly (I think)
	so don't need to specially enable -m64 in makefile
