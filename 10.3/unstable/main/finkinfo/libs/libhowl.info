Description: Cross-platform implementation of Zeroconf 
DescDetail: <<
Branded as Rendezvous(tm) by Apple Computer, Inc., Zeroconf standardizes 
networking protocols for delivering hassle-free ad-hoc networking, 
service discovery and IP configuration. This ease of use, enjoyed 
by users of Mac OS X, is now available as an SDK for Windows 2000/XP 
and many flavors of Unix. Howl allows software developers to easily 
embed Zeroconf functionality in their applications, making cumbersome 
and error-prone network configuration tasks seem so five minutes ago. 
Give your users what they want. Give them simple, elegant networking. 
Give them Howl.

Howl is open-source and royalty-free. We ask only that any fixes or 
improvements you make are fed back to us so we can ensure that we provide 
the most stable, best-quality cross-platform software for 
Zeroconf/Rendezvous networking.
