Description: <<
  Bayesian spam filter designed and tuned for speed
<<
DescDetail: <<
  Bogofilter is a mail filter that classifies mail as spam or non-spam
  by a statistical analysis of the message's header and content. The
  program is able to learn from the user's classifications and
  corrections.
<<
DescUsage: <<
  This filter can either be used via Procmail or integrated into the MTA.
  In either case, the filter must be trained to recognize both spam and
  non-spam.  See the man page for command line options for training, and for
  examples of Mutt keybindings to speed up the process.
  
  Quick Procmail configuration (taken from man page):

  The following procmail rule will take mail on stdin and direct it to 
  Mail/spam if bogofilter thinks it's spam:

  :OHB:
  ? bogofilter
