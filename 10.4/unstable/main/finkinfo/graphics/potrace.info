Description: Trace bitmaps into scalable vector graphics
DescDetail: <<
Potrace is a utility for tracing a bitmap, which means, transforming a
bitmap into a smooth, scalable image. The input is a bitmap (PBM, PGM,
PPM, or BMP), and the default output is one of several vector file
formats. A typical use is to create EPS files from scanned data, such
as company or university logos, handwritten notes, etc.  The resulting
image is not "jaggy" like a bitmap, but smooth. It can then be
rendered at any resolution.

Potrace can currently produce the following output formats: EPS,
PostScript, SVG (scalable vector graphics), PGM (for easy antialiasing
of pixel-based images), and XFig. An experimental Gimppath backend is
also provided. Additional backends might be added in the future.

A separate program, mkbitmap, is also provided. This program can act
as a pre-processor for potrace, applying scaling and various filters
to an image before converting it to a bitmap. This is useful for
potracing greyscale and color images.
