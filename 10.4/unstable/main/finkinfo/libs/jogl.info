Description: OpenGL bindings for Java
DescDetail: <<
The JOGL Project hosts a reference implementation of the Java bindings for
OpenGL API, and is designed to provide hardware-supported 3D graphics to
applications written in Java. It is part of a suite of open-source technologies
initiated by the Game Technology Group at Sun Microsystems. JOGL provides full
access to the APIs in the OpenGL 2.0 specification as well as nearly all vendor
extensions, and integrates with the AWT and Swing widget sets.
