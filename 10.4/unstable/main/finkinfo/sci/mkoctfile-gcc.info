Package: mkoctfile%type_pkg[oct]-gcc%type_pkg[gcc]%type_pkg[-atlas]
Type: gcc (4.6), oct(3.0.5 3.2.4), -atlas(boolean), nosource

Version: 1.0.3
Revision: 1

Description: Octave build tools using gcc%type_pkg[gcc]
DescDetail: <<
	Some Octave-forge packages need to be built using tools from Fink's 
	gcc%type_pkg-compiler package.  Some packages that hardcode hardcode 
	compiler paths rather than just using what the normal mkoctfile tool 
	calls for, including user overrides.  In such cases, an alternate
	mkoctfile script is useful, along with appropriate headers.
<<
DescUsage: <<
	To use %n in building a package, one will typically need to patch out 
	invocations of 'mkoctfile' in e.g. the Makefile.
	
	Any package that BuildDepends on this one will need also to
	carry a BuildDepends: octave%type_pkg[oct]-dev , as we can't specify
	a Depends: in this package, since octave%type_pkg[oct]-dev is 
	BuildDependsOnly.
