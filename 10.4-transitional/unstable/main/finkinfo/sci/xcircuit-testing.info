Description: Circuit drawing app with schematic capture
DescDetail: <<
XCircuit is a UNIX/X11 (and now Windows, if you have an X-Server running) 
program for drawing publishable-quality electrical circuit schematic diagrams 
and related figures, and produce circuit netlists through schematic capture. 
XCircuit regards circuits as inherently hierarchical, and writes both 
hierarchical PostScript output and hierarchical SPICE netlists. 
Circuit components are saved in and retrieved from libraries which are fully 
editable. XCircuit does not separate artistic expression from circuit drawing; 
it maintains flexiblity in style without compromising the power of schematic 
capture.

XCircuit is flexible enough to be used as a generic program for drawing just 
about anything, and is competitive with powerful programs such as "xfig". 
It is especially good for any task requiring repeated use of a standard set of 
graphical objects, including architectural drawing, printed circuit board 
layouts, and (my personal favorite) music typography.

This package represents the upstream "Development" branch.

DescUsage: <<
 Depending on your X11 environment, dialog boxes can get buried
behind the main window.

DescPort: <<
Needed to add -fno-common to CFLAGS.
Added -I/usr/X11R6/include to CFLAGS because it wouldn't work with 
CPPFLAGS.  This is needed because the linker apparently can't find
the X11 headers by default on XFree86 or Xorg.
Patch Makefile.in to install manpage in Fink-appropriate location because 
Makefile doesn't honor --mandir=foo and to make sure that xcircuit.dylb
has a proper install_name.
%p/lib/xcircuit-3.6/xcircuit.dylib is a private library, not to be linked
by any other package.
