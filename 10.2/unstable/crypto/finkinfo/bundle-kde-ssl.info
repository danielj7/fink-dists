DescDetail: <<
This package doesn't install any files of itself, but makes sure that
you have a fully-functional KDE 3.1.x system through dependencies.

DescUsage: <<
---[ Installation ]---------------------------------------------------

To install all of the official KDE packages, install "bundle-kde" or
"bundle-kde-ssl" (depending on whether crypotgraphic laws permit
downloading strong cryptography).

---[ Configuration ]--------------------------------------------------

To use KDE as your windowing system in XDarwin, create a file called
".xinitrc" in your home directory, with the following lines:

  source /sw/bin/init.sh
  /sw/bin/startkde >/tmp/kde.log 2>&1

Note that this will overwrite an existing .xinitrc file!

If you are using Apple's X11 but want to use the KDE window manager,
put the following line before the startkde line:

  export KDEWM=kwin

---[ Startup ]--------------------------------------------------------

Once you have created an ~/.xinitrc file, you should be able to start
KDE by clicking on the "XDarwin" icon in your Applications folder.  
   
NOTE: If you plan on running in rootless mode, you will likely want to
disable desktop icons, or else the root window desktop will cover up
your Aqua destkop.  You can do this by starting the KDE control
center, expanding the "Desktop" list, click "Behavior", and uncheck   
the "Enable icons on desktop" checkbox.
   
---[ Removal ]--------------------------------------------------------
   
To remove all of the official KDE packages, you can remove aRts and
anything that depends on it, by running (in a terminal):
   
  sudo apt-get remove arts
