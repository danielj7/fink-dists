Package: fwipe
Version: 0.35
Revision: 2
Description: Deletes files irrecoverably
License: BSD
Suggests: srm
DescDetail: <<
fwipe provides a fast, secure way of deleting files irrecoverably. Each
regular file is overwritten with 0's and 1's several times, and then
deleted.

fwipe is also reliable. fwipe0 won't be fooled by filenames containing
white space, dashes, carriage returns, or anything else. Neither will
fwipe, if the user is careful to quote arguments properly.

fwipe is potentially dangerous, so please read all of the man pages and the
web page before using it.

Be aware that there is NO CONFIRMATION and the files you wipe can NOT be
recovered by any means!

DescPort: <<
Use cc instead of gcc for building and linking (for pre-Jaguar systems).

The custom Makefile ignores conf-root file and uses only conf-home, so
hier.c is patched to install the man files into the share directory.

Due to Mac OS X's handling of filename case, make overwrites the
INSTALL doc during the build process so it must be renamed beforehand.
