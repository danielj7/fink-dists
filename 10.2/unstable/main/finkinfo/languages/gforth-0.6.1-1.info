Description: Fast and portable ANS Forth implementation
DescDetail: <<
Gforth is a fast and portable implementation of the ANS Forth
language. It works nicely with the Emacs editor, offers some nice
features such as input completion and history and a powerful locals
facility, and it even has a manual. Gforth employs traditional
implementation techniques: its inner innerpreter is indirect or direct
threaded.
<<
DescPort: <<
Had to add a dummy emacs directory because the makefile checks its existence.
The debugger is broken in 0.6.1, use 0.5.0 if you need it.
