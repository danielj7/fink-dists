DescDetail: <<
- It has many features to process text files and to do system
  management tasks (as in Perl).
- It is simple, straight-forward, extensible, and portable, and free.
- It has simple syntax, partially inspired by Eiffel and Ada.
- All data in Ruby is an object, not in the sense of Python or Perl,
  but in the sense of Smalltalk: no exceptions.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
The Ruby tcltk extension is packaged separately and links against Fink's X11
version of tcltk. It could be replaced with a version linked against an Aqua
tcltk if someone packaged it.

Packages should depend on ruby22 to run scripts. The shared library
does not provide many of the stdlib features, they are implemented in
the bundled extensions.

The extensions would link and probably run with Apple's libraries but
since Fink has its own version of ncurses, readline, etc. it should
always link with Fink's to get consistent results.

Move mkmf script into -dev to make extension configuration error out
instead of failing all tests.
