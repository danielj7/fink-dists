DescDetail: <<
Test::Pod lets you check the validity of a POD file, and report its
results in standard Test::Simple fashion.  It uses Pod::Simple to do
the heavy lifting.

Module authors can put code into a t/pod.t file and have Test::Pod
automatically find and check all POD files in a module distribution.
You can also specify a list of files to check, using the
all_pod_files() function.

DescPackaging: <<
	Former maintainer: Blair Zajac <blair@orcaware.com>

	Makefile.PL lists a Module::Build dependency because
	Makefile.PL was generated from Build.PL and package needs at
	least a certain version of Module::Build to build by the
	Build.PL route. But using Makefile.PL, Module::Build is not
	used, nor is Module::Build used within the actual Test::Pod
	module.
