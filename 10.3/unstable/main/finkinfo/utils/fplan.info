Description: Flight Planning Tool
DescDetail: <<
 Fplan is an application designed to assist general aviation pilots in 
 creating flight plans for cross country flights in powered aircraft.
<<

DescUsage: <<
 Fplan requires a database of airports, VORs, etc to do anything useful.
 You can download an out of date database of US airports and navaids at 
 http://www.ibiblio.org/fplan/download.html.  The database should be
 expanded and the files copied to /sw/share/fplan
 
 Read the FAQ for info on obtaining databases for Austria and Germany.
 http://www.ibiblio.org/fplan/FAQ
 
 You can purchase a current US database from the FAA.  Go to 
 http://www.faa.gov and search for "National Flight Database".
 See the User's Guide for info on how to convert this database so
 fplan can use it.

 Use paddb to create a personal database if desired.  paddb is very 
 particular about the format of the input file.  See the User's Quide and
 man 5 fplan.

 Note: fplan courses and distances are based on rhumb lines, not great 
 circles.

DescPort: <<
 The patch modifies config.h to disable the graphical preview interface (it
 won't build) and modifies the Makefile to prevent it from installing files
 outside Fink's build process.
