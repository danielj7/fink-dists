Description: Tool for distributing files
DescDetail: <<
 BitTorrent is a tool for distributing files. It's extremely easy to use -
downloads are started by clicking on hyperlinks. Whenever more than one
person is downloading at once they send pieces of the file(s) to each
other, thus relieving the central server's bandwidth burden. Even with many 
simultaneous downloads, the upload burden on the central server remains
quite small, since each new downloader introduces new upload capacity.
