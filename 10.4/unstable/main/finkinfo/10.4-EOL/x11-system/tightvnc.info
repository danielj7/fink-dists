Description: Enhanced version of VNC
DescDetail: <<
Installs vnc with various encoding enhancements, plus
addition of '-tunnel' option to viewer.
<<
DescPort: <<
Uses Imake. 
Requires XFree86 development stuff (Xprog.tgz), and perl.
#Includes tight encoding patches.
User must add /usr/X11R6/bin to PATH in order to run vncserver.
The "-localhost" and "-inetd" options for Xvnc are broken on MacOS X/Darwin.
Includes mini http server and java applet for remote access via a web browser.
Detailed usage instructions at http://www.uk.research.att.com/vnc.

Fix some implicit declarations of system functions.

Remove Xos.h includes that don't seem to work (too much fiddling with
tokens earlier?) and aren't needed (re-add in specific .c if we find
implicit declarations).

Fix fink-path flag-passing for compiler.

Darwin doesn't have libcrypt (and doesn't seem to need it)
