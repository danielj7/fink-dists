DescDetail: <<
Beeswax is an information management system inspired by Lotus Agenda. It aims
to recreate Agenda's flexibility and efficiency in a clutter-free, text-based
user interface with vi key bindings. Beeswax views & reports will have
specifications for sections, columns, filtering, and sorting.

The concept is that you have a database of information stored as individual
items. Each item is a bit of information shown on the screen with a small
bullet character at the beginning. In addition, each item can have a note
attached to it to hold more extensive information. Notes are stored within the
Beeswax database, but are edited by Beeswax launching your favorite text
editor. When an item has a note attached, there is a small musical note
displayed at the beginning of the item.
