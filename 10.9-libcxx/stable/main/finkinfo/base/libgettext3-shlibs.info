Description: GNU Internationalization utils (shared libs)

DescDetail: <<
  The gettext packages provides some of the i18n and l10n support used by
  many GNU programs, but which is missing from the Darwin C library.
<<

DescPort: <<
  charset.alias is deleted because it is empty on Darwin anyway and
  causes unnecessary conflicts between packages.

  The emacs files have been moved to a separate gettext-emacs package
  (EMACS=no prevents them from being compiled here).
<<

DescPackaging: <<
  We now follow the packaging advice from the upstream authors, and have
  separated gettext-tools into its own package (a separate build from
  the same source).  The libraries from that portion have gone into
  libgettextpo2-*.

  However, we have retained the idea of a gettext-doc splitoff from
  the previous version of libgettext3-shlibs, which was prepared by
  Chris Zubrzycki.
