DescDetail: <<
  PCRS is a small library, written as a supplement to the PCRE library, that implements regex based substitution with the syntax and semantics of Perl's s/// operator. Source code for a small demo program (pcrsed) is included with the documentation.
<<
DescPort: <<
  Added aclocal.m4 in order to include the AC_caolan_CHECK_PACKAGE macro (available from GNU Autoconf Macro Archive <http://www.gnu.org/software/ac-archive/>). This provides the --with-LIB=DIR option to configure so we can force it to look for pcre in /sw/lib.

  Patched configure.in to use AC_caolan_CHECK_PACKAGE instead of AC_CHECK_LIB when looking for pcre.

  The LIBS variable is coming out of configure as -lpcre -lpcre for some reason, but that shouldn't make any difference, so I see no pressing need to fix it.

  Patched Makefile.in:

    * Added INCLUDEDIR = @includedir@, and added install for pcrs.h -> $(prefix)/include.
    * Removed -pedantic from CFLAGS.
    * Changed -shared to -dynamic in LIBFLAGS.
    * Changed -fPIC to -fno-common.
    * Added $(LDFLAGS) and -L. -lpcrs to pcrsed target. Removed unnecessary pcrsed recompile from install target.
    * Switched to Darwin shared library conventions:
      * libpcrs.so.0.0.2 => libpcrs.0.0.2.dylib
      * -install_name $(prefix)/libpcrs.0.dylib
      * -current_version 0.0.2
    * Note: compatibility_version has been left to default to 0, because you can't explicitly tell it to be 0 (curse these difficult version numbers!)
    * Added installs for bin, lib, include and man directories.
    * Added link to libpcrs.0.dylib.
    * Fixed targets so that it doesn't recompile everything unnecessarily when you "make install".

DescPackaging: <<
  Added a copy of the LGPL, as for some reason it wasn't included in the distribution, even though it says it should be there in pcrs.c!

  Put a copy of pcrsed.c in DocFiles because it's intended as a demo.
