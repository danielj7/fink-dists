Package: pygtk
Version: 0.6.9
Revision: 13
Distribution: 10.3, 10.4
Description: Placeholder for versioned pygtk packages
DescDetail: <<
Python bindings for the GTK widget set.

PyGTK provides an object oriented interface that is slightly higher
level than the C one. It automatically does all the type casting and
reference counting that you would have to do normally with the C API.

PyGTK currently explicitly supports Python 2.2 and 2.3; it does not
support Python 2.1.
