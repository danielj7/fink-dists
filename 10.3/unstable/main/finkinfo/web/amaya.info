Description:	W3C's Editor/Browser
DescDetail: <<
	Amaya is a complete web browsing and authoring 
	environment and comes equipped with a "WYSIWYG style" 
	of interface, similar to that of the most popular commercial 
	browsers. With such an interface, users can easily generate
	HTML and XHTML pages, as well as CSS style sheets, MathML
	expressions, and SVG drawings (full support of SVG is not yet
	available, though).
	Amaya includes a collaborative annotation application based
	on Resource Description Framework (RDF), XLink, and
	XPointer.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
	Patches the configure script to stop it checking for appkit
	(bad amaya) in both Amaya and libwww (which one person raised
	as a problem). Also fixes bug linking to shared graphics
	libs.
	Patches Makefile.libwww to link statically to the Amaya libwww
	(otherwise build conflict with libwww). This can be fixed simply,
	but for 10.3, gcc 3.3 only.
	Patches Options.in to fix precomps problem, find gtk headers,
	and ensure graphics libs linked.
	Slight hack to make Amaya install in /sw/share/Amaya with
	link from /sw/bin/amaya to amaya executable. (Default would
	have /sw/Amaya, which isn't pretty).
	Enables dav (due to configure error).
