Description: The GNU Project Debugger
DescDetail: <<
GDB, the GNU Project debugger, allows you to see what is going on
`inside' another program while it executes -- or what another program
was doing at the moment it crashed.
<<
DescUsage: <<
The programs in this package are prefixed with fsf- (gdb is "fsf-gdb",
etc.) to avoid conflicting with Xcode's programs of the same name.
<<
InstallScript:<<
#!/bin/bash -ev
make install DESTDIR=%d
cd %i/share/info
rm annotate.info configure.info stabs.info standards.info bfd.info

# It seems likely that the libbfd, libopcodes, libiberty and their headers may
# also exist in some other packages
rm -rf %i/lib %i/include
<<
PostInstScript: <<
# Make the executables sgid procmod
chgrp procmod %p/bin/fsf-%n
chgrp procmod %p/bin/fsf-%ntui
chmod g+s %p/bin/fsf-%n
chmod g+s %p/bin/fsf-%ntui
