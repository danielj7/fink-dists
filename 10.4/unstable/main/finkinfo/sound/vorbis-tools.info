# DISCLAIMER: Max Horn is the sole maintainer of this package.
# Please DO NOT MAKE MODIFICATIONS without informing the maintainer.
# Preferably, send a patch to me instead of making changes yourself!
# If that is not possible due to extra urgency, at least send me a mail.
#
# Explanation: I am sick and tired of getting back to my packages and
# discovering that people have messed with it. I am then forced to
# retrace their steps, find out who, when and why did make a certain
# change etc. -- i.e. it makes my life as maintainer harder.
# Furthermore, as maintainer I am responsible for problems caused by my
# packages. But I am not willing to take responsibility for something I
# did not do. In particular, for changes that other people introduced
# behind my back, no matter how good and noble their intentions were. As
# such, I may see myself forced to drop responsibility for (and hence,
# maintainership of) the affected package.

Description: The Ogg Vorbis CODEC tools
DescDetail: <<
Ogg Vorbis is a fully Open, non-proprietary, patent-and-royalty-free, 
general-purpose compressed audio format for mid to high quality 
(8kHz-48.0kHz, 16+ bit, polyphonic) audio and music at fixed and 
variable bitrates from 16 to 128 kbps/channel. This places Vorbis 
in the same competetive class as audio representations such as 
MPEG-4 (AAC), and similar to, but higher performance than MPEG-1/2 
audio layer 3, MPEG-4 audio (TwinVQ), WMA and PAC.
.
Vorbis is the first of a planned family of Ogg multimedia coding 
formats being developed as part of Xiph.org's Ogg multimedia project. 
.
This package includes: ogg123, oggdec, oggenc, ogginfo, vcut, vorbiscomment

DescPort: <<
The patch is a hack to solve the problem with ogg123 hanging at exit,
plus a change to make it compile with newer libcurl versions.

<<
DescPackaging: <<
 The versioned dependency on libcurl4 (>= 7.16.3-102) is there because in 
 that version libcurl4 switched from libssh2 to libssh2.1

 Originally packaged by Evan Jones.
