DaemonicName: dhcp
Description: DHCP Server/Client by the ISC
DescDetail: <<
The ISC Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Distribution provides a freely
redistributable reference implementation of all aspects of the DHCP protocol,
through a suite of DHCP tools:

 - A DHCP server
 - A DHCP client
 - A DHCP relay agent

These tools all use a modular APIB which is designed to be sufficiently general
that it can easily be made to work on POSIX-compliant operating systems and
also non-POSIX systems like Windows NT and MacOS.

The DHCP server, client and relay agent are provided both as reference
implementations of the protocol and as working, fully-featured sample
implementations. Both the client and the server provide functionality that,
while not strictly required by the protocol, is very useful in practice. The
DHCP server also makes allowances for non-compliant clients which one might
still like to support.
