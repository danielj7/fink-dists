+in the arbitration and to respond to no more than
+twenty-five single question interrogatories.  All awards are
+payable in US dollars and may include for the prevailing
+party (i) pre-judgment interest, (ii) reasonable attorneys
+fees incurred in connection with the arbitration, and (iii)
+reasonable costs and expenses incurred in enforcing the
+award.
