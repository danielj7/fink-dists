Description: Portable multitasking & networking framework
DescDetail: <<
	POE is a framework for cooperative, event driven multitasking and
	networking in Perl. Other languages have similar frameworks. Python has
	Twisted. TCL has "the event loop".

	POE provides a unified interface for several other event loops,
	including select(), IO::Poll, Glib, Gtk, Tk, Wx, and Gtk2. Many of
	these event loop interfaces were written by others, with the help of
	POE::Test::Loops.
