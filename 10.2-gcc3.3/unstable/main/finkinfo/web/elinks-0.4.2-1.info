Description: Development version of Links text WWW browser
DescDetail: <<
Development version of Links (Lynx-like text WWW browser), with more
liberal features policy and development style.

This is the ELinks tree - intended to provide a feature-rich version
of Links. Its purpose is to provide an alternative to Links, and to
test and tune various new features, but still provide good rock-solid
releases inside stable branches.

DescPort: <<
There's a bug in the ./configure test for lua. Not sure if this is
symptomatic of other lua problems so disabling lua support for now.
