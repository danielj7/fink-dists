DescDetail: <<
  This package exports a LockFile class which provides a simple API
  for locking files. Unlike the Windows msvcrt.locking function, the
  fcntl.lockf and flock functions, and the deprecated posixfile
  module, the API is identical across both Unix (including Linux and
  Mac) and Windows platforms.  The lock mechanism relies on the atomic
  nature of the link (on Unix) and mkdir (on Windows) system calls. An
  implementation based on SQLite is also provided, more as a
  demonstration of the possibilities it provides than as
  production-quality code.
