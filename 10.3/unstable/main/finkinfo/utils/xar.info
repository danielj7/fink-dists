Description: The eXtensible ARchiver
DescDetail: <<
xar is an archiver meant to handle the archival tasks of the 21st 
century.  It handles Extended Attributes, ACLs, Resource Forks, can
extract archives to match up the usernames/groupnames of files it
has archived (as opposed to just matching up uids/gids), and can
make you coffee.
