Description: LZMA file compressor
DescDetail: <<
	Lzip is a lossless file compressor based on the LZMA (Lempel-Ziv-Markov
	chain-Algorithm) algorithm designed by Igor Pavlov. The high
	compression of LZMA comes from combining two basic, well-proven
	compression ideas: sliding dictionaries (i.e. LZ77/78), and markov
	models (i.e. the thing used by every compression algorithm that uses a
	range encoder or similar order-0 entropy coder as its last stage) with
	segregation of contexts according to what the bits are used for.

	Lzip is not a replacement for gzip or bzip2, but a complement; which
	one is best to use depends on user's needs. Gzip is the fastest and
	most widely used. Bzip2 compresses better than gzip but is slower, both
	compressing and decompressing. Lzip decompresses almost as fast as gzip
	and compresses better than bzip2, but requires more memory and time
	during compression. These features make lzip well suited for software
	distribution and data archival.
