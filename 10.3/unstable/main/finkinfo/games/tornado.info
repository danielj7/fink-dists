Description: Networkable text-based weather destruction
DescDetail: <<
Clone of the original C64 game.
The goal of the game is to destroy the opponent's house with certain
weather phenomenon: rain, snow, hail, lightning and tornado. The game
can be played together (two players), against the computer (or two
computer players against each other) or over a TCP connection.
For a more detailed description of the game see tornado's manpage.
