# DISCLAIMER: Max Horn is the sole maintainer of this package.
# Please DO NOT MAKE MODIFICATIONS without informing the maintainer.
# Preferably, send a patch to me instead of making changes yourself!
# If that is not possible due to extra urgency, at least send me a mail.
#
# Explanation: I am sick and tired of getting back to my packages and
# discovering that people have messed with it. I am then forced to
# retrace their steps, find out who, when and why did make a certain
# change etc. -- i.e. it makes my life as maintainer harder.
# Furthermore, as maintainer I am responsible for problems caused by my
# packages. But I am not willing to take responsibility for something I
# did not do. In particular, for changes that other people introduced
# behind my back, no matter how good and noble their intentions were. As
# such, I may see myself forced to drop responsibility for (and hence,
# maintainership of) the affected package.

general-purpose compressed audio format for audio and music at fixed
and variable bitrates from 16 to 128 kbps/channel.
<<
DescPort: <<
- Uses patch to change document location.
- Patch adds a workaround for an incompatibility with LLVM, see
  https://trac.xiph.org/ticket/1707
- In libvorbis-1.0, binary compatibility breaks with libvorbisfile. So
it was renamed to libvorbis0. To allow users to upgrade from libvorbis-
shlibs to libvorbis0-shlibs, libvorbit0-shlibs has Provides, Conflicts
and Replaces fields following to Debian Library Packaging guide:
