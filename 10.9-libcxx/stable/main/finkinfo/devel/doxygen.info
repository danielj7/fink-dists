Description: Documentation system for C++, Java, IDL and C
DescDetail: <<
	Doxygen is a documentation system for C++, Java, IDL and C

	1.  It can generate an on-line documentation browser (in HTML) and/or 
	an off-line reference manual (in  ) from a set of documented source 
	files. There is also support for generating output in RTF (MS-Word), 
	PostScript, hyperlinked PDF, compressed HTML, and Unix man pages. The 
	documentation is extracted directly from the sources, which makes it 
	much easier to keep the documentation consistent with the source code.

	2. Doxygen can be configured to extract the code structure from 
	undocumented source files. This can be very useful to quickly find 
	your way in large source distributions. The relations between the 
	various elements are be visualized by means of include dependency 
	graphs, inheritance diagrams, and collaboration diagrams, which are 
	all generated automatically.

	Docs are now built and installed by the package doxygen-doc

* Bumped to 1.8.9.1 by Hanspeter for 10.9-libcxx tree.
* Bumped by Matthias Neeracher <neeracher@mac.com>, upgraded for 10.7 tree.
* Modified by Michele Garoche <michele.garoche@easyconnect.fr>

DescPackaging: <<
	Disable OSX portability games (no SDKs, no -arch flags)
	because it's more portable than fink needs to support and
	leads to build chaos.

	Explicitly point to internal libmd5.la to avoid attempting 
	unsuccessfully to link to the libmd5 from libwww-shlibs.
	
	LIBICONV_PLUG removed to avoid pulling in header/lib mismatch 
	between system and Fink libiconv.
