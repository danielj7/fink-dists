Description: Processing and Displaying Swath Sonar Data
DescDetail: <<
Warning: GSF support with be disabled soon.  -Kurt Schwehr, Jan 2014.

MB-System is an open source software package for the processing and
display of bathymetry and backscatter imagery data derived from
multibeam, interferometry, and sidescan sonars. This software is
distributed freely (and for free) in the form of source code for Unix
platforms. The heart of the system is an input/output library called
MBIO which allows programs to work transparently with any of a number
of supported swath sonar data formats. This approach has allowed the
creation of "generic" utilities which can be applied in a uniform
manner to sonar data from a variety of sources. Most of the programs
are command-line tools, but the package does include graphical tools
for editing swath bathymetry, editing navigation, modeling bathymetry
calculation, and adjusting survey navigation.

Has its own internal proj library that will not be installed so that
it will not conflict with the standard proj.

DescPort: <<
The betas are production code, just missing some documentation.
Enough bugs are fixed such that it makes sense to package the
beta as final.  Support for Mac OSX 10.4 dropped on 20-Jul-2009.
<<
DescUsage: <<
Take a look at the MB-Cookbook:

http://www.mbari.org/data/mbsystem/mb-cookbook/index.html

Also, if you want the scripts to open the Apple Preview application,
set your MB_PS_VIEWER to open or you can use mbdefaults to set a viewer:

  mbdefaults -D open
