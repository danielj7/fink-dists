Description: Creates an app defaults directory for fink
DescDetail: <<
Creates an app-defaults directory within the fink tree, links
all /etc/X11/app-defaults files into this directory, and sets the environment
variable XAPPLRESDIR to point to this directory.  Other X11 apps in the
fink systems which have app-defaults files referred to via the
XAPPLRESDIR environment variable can be made to "depend" on this package;
they should install their app-default files in /sw/etc/app-defaults.
