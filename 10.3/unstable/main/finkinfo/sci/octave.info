Description: Matlab-like language for computations
DescDetail: <<
It provides a convenient command line interface for solving linear and 
nonlinear problems numerically, and for performing other numerical 
experiments using a language that is mostly compatible with Matlab.
It may also be used as a batch-oriented language.

Octave has extensive tools for solving common numerical linear algebra
problems, finding the roots of nonlinear equations, integrating ordinary
functions, manipulating polynomials, and integrating ordinary differential
and differential-algebraic equations. It is easily extensible and 
customizable via user-defined functions written in Octave's own language, 
or using dynamically loaded modules written in C++, C, Fortran, 
or other languages.
<<
DescUsage: << 
 To use mkoctfile to build dynamically loadable modules, you will need 
 to install the hdf5, readline and fftw3 packages.
 Octave cannot Depend on them since they are BuildDependsOnly.
<<
DescPort: <<
 Thanks to Per Persson for most (if not all) of the work on the macos X port.
