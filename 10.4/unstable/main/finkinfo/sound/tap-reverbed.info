DescDetail: <<

TAP Reverb Editor is the standalone JACK counterpart of the LADSPA
plugin TAP Reverberator, which is part of the TAP-plugins LADSPA
plugin set. This means that the two programs/plugins perform the same
audio processing, but they have some advantages over each other:

TAP Reverberator is a LADSPA plugin. It has limited capabilities with
regard to the user interface (besides global plugin parameters, only
the Reverb Type can be chosen; changing any internal parameter is not
possible). On the other hand, it can be automated when used in
powerful host programs such as Ardour.
TAP Reverb Editor is a separate JACK application. It has its own
special user interface that allows for changing any internal parameter
on-the-fly, as well as plotting the impulse response of Reverb Types
as a visual aid. On the other hand, it cannot be automated from other
programs; its main use is to allow for developing one's own Reverb
Types.
Reverb Types created with this program can be easily 'exported' into
the LADSPA version. (Easily means: you have to copy two files and
re-compile TAP-plugins.) For a detailed description of this process,
please refer to the manual.

To get satisfactory results with TAP Reverb Editor, you will need to
set your system up to run JACK well. See http://jackit.sf.net for
details.

This program relies on The GIMP Toolkit (GTK+) version 2.0. You need
the GTK+-2.0 development libraries correctly installed to be able to
compile.
