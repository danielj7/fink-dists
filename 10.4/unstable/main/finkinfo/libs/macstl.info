Description: SIMD-accelerated C++ generic library
DescDetail: <<
The C++ header library designed to bring the world of generic programming to 
the Macintosh, and deliver the surprising speed of SIMD in an intuitive 
cross-platform package. 

Generic programming is the art -- some say, the black art -- of making 
software components super-reusable and yet ultra-efficient.  
Our tool is the C++ template, and our result is code nearly as fast as 
hand-coded machine language.

macstl was inspired by the premier generic library, the Standard Template 
Library (now part of the C++ Standard Library), but with a distinct 
Macintosh flavor.  Many components let you use low-level Mac OS X 
functionality like SIMD acceleration and memory copy-on-write easily and 
intuitively.

macstl is dual-licensed under the open-source Reciprocal Public License (RPL)
and the proprietary Pixelglow Source License (PSL).
<<
DescPackaging: <<
This is built/installed unix-style, not using Xcode's build.  
Thus, the macstl.framework is not installed.
<<
DescUsage: <<
macstl only consists of headers, no static or shared libraries.
To use it, simply include pass -I%p/include to CPPFLAGS/CXXCPPFLAGS
during compilation.
