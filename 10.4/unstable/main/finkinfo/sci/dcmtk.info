parts the DICOM standard for medical image communication. It includes 
software for examining, constructing and converting DICOM image files, 
handling offline media, sending and receiving images over a network 
connection, as well as demonstration image storage and worklist servers.

To use this toolkit, it is useful to have a basic knowledge of the 
DICOM standard for medical image communication. Starting points are
<http://medical.nema.org/dicom.html> which has an online version
of the standard and David Clunies website <http://www.dclunie.com>
which also hosts the alt.medical.image FAQ and other very good 
information.
<<
DescPort: <<
This port includes a patch from the Debian distribution to correctly
install the dicom.dic file into share/ instead of lib/, see
http://forum.dcmtk.org/viewtopic.php?t=572 for more information.
