Description: PNG image format handling library
DescPort: <<
Doesn't use autoconf. Comes with a big selection of Makefiles
instead. We use the included Makefile for Darwin, which builds dynamic
libraries (the OS X Makefile only builds static libraries).  This
Makefile was written by Christoph Pfisterer for the fink project and 
accepted by the upstream maintainers of libpng.

The Makefile requires a small patch for 10.1 compatibility.
