DescDetail: <<
FindBugs is a program to find bugs in Java programs.  It looks for
instances of "bug patterns" --- code instances that are likely to be
errors.

Changes since version 0.7.1:

  * Incorporated patched version of BCEL, which allows classes
    compiled with JDK 1.5.0 beta to be analyzed
  * Fixed some bugs related to lookups of array classes
  * Fixed bug that prevented GUI from loading XML result files when
    running under JDK 1.5.0 beta
  * Added new experimental bug detector, LazyInit, which looks for
    potentially buggy lazy initializations of static fields
  * Because of long filenames, switched to distributing the source
    archive as a zip file rather than a tar file
  * The 0.7.1 source tarfile was botched - 0.7.2 has a valid source
    archive
  * Fixed some problems in the Ant build script
  * Fixed NullPointerException when checking Class-Path attribute for
    Jar files without manifests
  * Generate version numbers for the core and UI Eclipse plugins using
    the Version class; all version numbers are now in a common
    location

DescPackaging: <<
Findbugs itself is release under the LGPL, however the shell scripts that
launch the program contain some code subject to the Apache Software
License.

This is why I've set the License field to OSI-Approved

The "categorizeBugs", "countBugs" and "findExamples" scripts were in
0.7.1, and accidentally ommitted from 0.7.2 release. They should be
back in 0.7.3
