DescDetail: <<
 CGI::Compress::Gzip extends the CGI infrastructure to compresses
 output, whenever possible.  It uses IO::Zlib (a filehandle wrapper
 around the C zlib library).  If this is missing, the functionality
 degrades gracefully to the typical CGI behavior.  The programmer can
 selectively enable or disable the compression functionality at will.
 This module does not rely on any particular server setup.  It should
 work anywhere that CGI.pm works.
 .
 Apache mod_perl users may prefer the more straightforward
 implementation offered by the Apache::Compress or Apache::GzipChain
 modules, although those offer less control to the programmer.
