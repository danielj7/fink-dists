Description: Default files for pkg-config implementations
DescUsage: <<
%p/share/%n/pc-path contains the default search-paths list for
locating .pc files. Current precedence of .pc searching is:
  1. fink arch-dependent
  2. fink arch-independent
  3. system X11 (recent-version location) arch-dependent
  4. system X11 (recent-version location) arch-independent
  5. system X11 (older-version location) arch-dependent
  6. system X11 (older-version location) arch-independent
  7. system itself

%p/share/%n/pc-resort is a script that is used to wrap an actual
pkg-config program. The actual program should be renamed to append
".real" to its filename, and this sript installed at the original
actual program-name instead. This wrapper re-sorts the lists of -I and
-L flags are re-sorted to place all fink paths before any system (/usr
or X11) paths; other paths come first, so env vars can be used to hide
fink altogether or to supercede fink paths with ones from non-default
locations, such as  /usr/local or other prefixes.
