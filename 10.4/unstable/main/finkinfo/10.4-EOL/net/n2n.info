Description: Layer Two Peer-to-Peer VPN
DescDetail: <<
  n2n is a layer-two peer-to-peer virtual private network (VPN)
  which allows users to exploit features typical of P2P applications
  at network instead of application level. This means that users can
  gain native IP visibility (e.g. two PCs belonging to the same n2n
  network can ping each other) and be reachable with the same
  network IP address regardless of the network where they
  currently belong. In a nutshell, as OpenVPN moved SSL from
  application (e.g. used to implement the https protocol) to
  network protocol, n2n moves P2P from application to network
  level.
