Description: Similar to netcat - enhanced and specialized
DescDetail: <<
 'netrw' is a simple (but powerful) tool for transporting data over the
 Internet. Its simplifies and speeds up file transfers to hosts without
 an FTP server. It can also be used for uploading data to another user.
 It is something like one-way netcat (nc) with some nice features
 concerning data transfers. It computes and checks message digests (MD5,
 SHA-1, and some others) of the data being transferred, and prints
 information on progress and average speed. At the end, it sums up
 the transfer.

DescUsage: <<
 * basic and the most usual scenario:
    1. on server.somewhere.net run

        $ netread 1234 >data.zip

    2. on host.domain.org run

        $ netwrite server.somewhere.net 1234 <data.zip

 * when the server is protected by firewall (and the host is not) or when
  you want the connection to be initiated by reader, you have to use
  this scenario:
    1. on host.domain.org run

        $ netwrite -f 1234 <data.zip

    2. on server.somewhere.net run

        $ netread -f host.domain.org 1234 >data.zip

 * when you are both writer and reader, you can run the following
  commands on one of the two machines only:
    * on host.domain.org run

        $ ssh server.somewhere.net 'netread 1234 >data.zip' &>/dev/null &
        $ netwrite server.somewhere.net 1234 <data.zip

    * OR on server.somewhere.net run

        $ netread 1234 >data.zip 2>/dev/null &
        $ ssh host.domain.org 'netwrite server.somewhere.net 1234 <data.zip'

 When you want to send more than one file, you have to use a bit
 complicated commands:

    * On Unix-like systems you can make use of tar and pipes:

        $ netread 1234 | tar xf -
        $ tar cf - <some_files> | netwrite server.somewhere.net 1234
