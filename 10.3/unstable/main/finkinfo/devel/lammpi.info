DescDetail: <<
LAM (Local Area Multicomputer) is an MPI programming environment and 
development system for heterogeneous computers on a network.  With LAM, a 
dedicated cluster or an existing network computing infrastructure can act 
as one parallel computer solving one problem. 

LAM features extensive debugging support in the application development 
cycle and peak performance for production applications.  LAM features a 
full implementation of the MPI communication standard.

DescPackaging: <<
Please Note: If you are on a case-insensitive file system (e.g. Mac HFS 
Extended), your c++ wrapper compiler will be named mpic++. If on a case-
sensitive file system (e.g. UFS), your c++ wrapper compiler will be named 
mpiCC. Builds with ROMIO, fortran, c++ and trillium support.
