Description: Text screen based source browsing tool
DescDetail: <<
Cscope is a text screen based source browsing tool.  Although it is
primarily designed to search C code (including lex and yacc files), it
can also be used for C++ code.  Using cscope, you can easily search for
where symbols are used and defined.
