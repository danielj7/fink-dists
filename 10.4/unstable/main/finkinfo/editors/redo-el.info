DescDetail: <<
From http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/RedoMode:

Emacs treats 'undo' as just another command. Therefore you can undo
the undo. This is powerful and confusing, because if you are doing
several undos and miss the "correct spot", and do anything at all
which is not an undo command, you will be stuck: You broke the chain
of undos. When you realize your mistake and try to undo some more, you
will first undo your previous undos, then undo the dos, and then you
can finally undo some more to find the correct spot. The problem is at
least as confusing as this description.
