DescDetail: <<

NanoBlogger is a small weblog engine written in Bash for the command
line. It uses common UNIX tools such as cat, grep and sed. It's free
to use and modify under the GNU General Public License.

Recommended that you change the browser to "open".

There is a GUI available here: http://www.dietzm.de/blog/

Upgrading:

See http://nanoblogger.sourceforge.net for more details on how to
upgrade.

Make sure that you regenerate your blog.conf file from scratch.  There
is currently a bug with TIDY_ARGS, so there MUST be a space in " ".
If you have TIDY_ARGS="", you will get empty html and feed files.

features include:

  intuitive commandline interface
  support for multiple weblogs
  support for multiple categories
  easy editing and management of entries
  archiving by category, entry, and month
  pagination
  permanent links
  RSS syndication (comes with RSS 1.0 and 2.0 formats)
  Atom syndication (comes with 0.3 format)
  templates and CSS style sheets for full control of appearance
  placeholders for easy template manipulation
  plugins for calendar, recent entries, weblog status, fortunes, etc.
  auto-formatting, e.g. line breaks translate to HTML
  support for relative and absolute links
  extensibility through parts (e.g. parts/2003-06.html)
  global configuration to set defaults (nb.conf)
  per-weblog configuration to override global defaults (blog.conf)
  intelligent build system, only rebuilds relative parts for a modified 
    entry
  simple cache system, for faster content generation
  auto-detection of weblog from current directory
  no dependency on any javascript, server-side scripting, or server-side
    includes
  no dependency on any special database (uses flat-file)
  multi-platform portability (or at least wherever there's bash and the
    required commands)
