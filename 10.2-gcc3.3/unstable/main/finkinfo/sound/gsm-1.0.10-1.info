Description: GSM speech compression utilities and libs
DescDetail: <<
Contains runtime shared libraries for libgsm, an implementation of the
European GSM 06.10 provisional standard for full-rate speech
transcoding, prI-ETS 300 036, which uses RPE/LTP (residual pulse
excitation/long term prediction) coding at 13 kbit/s.

GSM 06.10 compresses frames of 160 13-bit samples (8 kHz sampling rate,
i.e. a frame rate of 50 Hz) into 260 bits; for compatibility with
typical UNIX applications, our implementation turns frames of 160 16-bit
linear samples into 33-byte frames (1650 Bytes/s). The quality of the
algorithm is good enough for reliable speaker recognition; even music
often survives transcoding in recognizable form (given the bandwidth
limitations of 8 kHz sampling rate).

The interfaces offered are a front end modelled after compress(1), and a
library API. Compression and decompression run faster than realtime on
most SPARCstations. The implementation has been verified against the
ETSI standard test patterns.

the install rules to create directories before installing into them..
