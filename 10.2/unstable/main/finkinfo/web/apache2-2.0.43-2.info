Description: Powerful HTTP Web Server
DescDetail: <<
Apache is a powerful web source which is highly flexable. It has support
for modules, and is used on many large web sites throughout the net. It
used httpd.conf for all of it's configuration options, which are well documented.
<<
DescUsage: <<
The htdocs, and cgi-bin folders are installed in share/apache2 folder.
You can configure the server to suit your needs by editing the 
etc/apache2/httpd.conf file. It doesn't effect the built in apache webserver which 
is included with Mac OS X, but it will conflict if one, or the other is running 
at the same time.
Base and Extension modules are the only ones that are built, and should
be fine for most setups. The apachectl command included with this 
package will be used instead of the one that it included with OSX. If
you should need to use the OSX one, type /usr/sbin/apachectl, and use it
like you normally would.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
Apache2's prefix chooses the location of serveral directories that can't
be change with other configure options. Using the CompileScript option,
I overwrote Fink's defaults of ./configure --prefix option, and set the 
correct prefix manually.
