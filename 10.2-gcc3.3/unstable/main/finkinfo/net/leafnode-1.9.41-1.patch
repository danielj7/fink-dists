+Once the leafnode service has been installed there's still some
+important configuration yet to be done. There are 3 main steps:
+
+1) Edit @FINK_PREFIX@/etc/leafnode/config and set the server field to
+the address of your ISP's news feed.
+
+2) Run @FINK_PREFIX@/sbin/fetchnews to download the list of groups
+from your newsfeed.
+
+3) Schedule automated updating of active groups:
+   Leafnode tracks which groups have been accessed by clients and will
+   cache the articles in these `active' groups. The downloading is
+   performed by the fetchnews utility we just invoked manually, but
+   you likely don't want to have to do this every time you access
+   usenet.
+
+   The solution is to add to the `news' user's crontab and schedule
+   fetchnews to run hourly/daily/etc. Also important is to schedule
+   texpire to run in order to prune out older articles (the threshold
+   for what constitutes an `old' thread is set through the `expire'
+   field.
+
+   To set this up type:          sudo -u news crontab -e
+
+   Then add lines similar to:
+       0 4 * * *       @FINK_PREFIX@/sbin/texpire
+       0 * * * *       @FINK_PREFIX@/sbin/fetchnews
+
+   The above lines will set texpire to run nightly at 4am and will
+   update the articles cache every hour on the hour.
+
+enjoy!
