Version: 0.1-beta-3
Revision: 1
Description: OpenCL Python language extension
DescDetail: <<
CLyther is a python tool similar to Cython. CLyther is a python language
extension that makes writing OpenCL code as easy as Python itself. CLyther
currently only supports a subset of the Python language definition but adds
many new features to OpenCL. CLyther was inspired by PyCUDA and PyCUDA's 
views on Metaprogramming.

CLyther exposes both the OpenCL C library as well as the OpenCL language to
python.
