Description: Reimplementation of ctags(1) 
DescDetail: <<
Exuberant Ctags is a multilanguage reimplementation of the much-underused
ctags(1) program and is intended to be the mother of all ctags programs. It
generates indexes of source code definitions which are used by a number of
editors and tools. The motivation which drove the development of Exuberant
Ctags was the need for a ctags program which supported generation of tags
for all possible C language constructs (which no other ctags offers), and
because most were easily fooled by a number of preprocessor contructs.

Uses update-alternatives so as not to conflict with other ctags.
You may have to run 
   sudo update-alternatives --config ctags
to make sure you are using this package.
