DescDetail: <<
An intuitive, cross-platform graphical data analysis system.
It uses menus and dialogs to guide the user efficiently
through the data manipulation and analysis process, and has
an excel like spreadsheet for easy data frame visualization
and editing. Deducer works best when used with the Java based
R GUI JGR, but the dialogs can be called from the command line.
Dialogs have also been integrated into the Windows Rgui.
<<
DescUsage: <<
Deducer must be started from within the launched JGR, First start
JGR by executing "library(JGR)" and "JGR()" from the R terminal.
Then start Deducer by entering "library(Deducer)" from within
the JGR console window.
