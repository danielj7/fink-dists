Description: Lossless audio (de)compressor

DescDetail: <<
Shorten is an established low complexity waveform coder. It is fast and
has low memory usage and thus is suitable for stand alone or embedded
operation for a wide range of audio-like signals.

Shorten has two basic modes of operation:

lossless: The decompressed file is exactly the same as the original.
Typically a factor of two compression is obtained for 16 bit audio.

lossy: The compression may be specified either in terms of an average
number of bits per sample, or in terms of an acceptable (perceptually
weighted) signal to noise ratio. Good quality is obtained at compression
rates from 3:1 to 5:1 and thus it can be a good alternative to ADPCM.

The test fails if they are runned with the -l option, this is due the way fink 
-l function works.  See bug 1622550 for more information.
