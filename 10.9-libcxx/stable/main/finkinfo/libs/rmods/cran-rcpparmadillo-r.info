DescDetail: <<
R and Armadillo integration using Rcpp Armadillo is a templated
C++ linear algebra library (by Conrad Sanderson) that aims towards
a good balance between speed and ease of use. Integer, floating
point and complex numbers are supported, as well as a subset of
trigonometric and statistics functions. Various matrix decompositions
are provided through optional integration with LAPACK and ATLAS
libraries. A delayed evaluation approach is employed (during compile
time) to combine several operations into one, and to reduce (or
eliminate) the need for temporaries. This is accomplished through
recursive templates and template meta-programming. This library is
useful if C++ has been decided as the language of choice (due
to speed and/or integration capabilities), rather than another
language. The RcppArmadillo package includes the header files
from the templated Armadillo library. Thus users do not need to
install Armadillo itself in order to use RcppArmadillo. This
Armadillo integration provides a nice illustration of the
capabilities of the Rcpp package for seamless R and C++
integration. Armadillo is licensed under the MPL 2.0, while
RcppArmadillo (the Rcpp bindings/bridge to Armadillo) is
licensed under the GNU GPL version 2 or later, as is the
rest of Rcpp.
