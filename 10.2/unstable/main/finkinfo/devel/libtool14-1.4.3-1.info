Description: Shared library build helper, v1.4
DescDetail: <<
GNU libtool knows how to build shared libraries on a wide range of
platforms. It is designed to work with autoconf to add painless shared
library support to GNU packages.

libtool 1.4 was a major change - it is now fully integrated with
autoconf. Converting packages is non-trivial and many still use 1.3.5,
therefore the new version is a separate package.
<<
DescPort: <<
Supports Darwin out of the box, the patches for Mac OS X 10.1 have
been merged into the upstream release.

Needs dlcompat to provide dynamic loading via libltdl.

Uses a 'g' prefix to avoid a naming conflict with Apple's libtool
program (which is completely unrelated).
