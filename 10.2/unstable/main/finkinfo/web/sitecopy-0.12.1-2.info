Description: Web site uploader
DescDetail: <<
sitecopy keeps your web site in sync with a local directory. It
uploads new or changed files and delete obsolete file from the
server. It supports FTP and WebDAV.

The GNOME frontend is packaged separately as xsitecopy.

This package doesn't build SSL support, use sitecopy-ssl instead if
you need it. For this reason, we can't link against neon-ssl, as
that would imply a ssl dependency in the resulting binary.
<<
DescPort: <<
Uses autoconf, but custom Makefiles. Not all Makefiles
use CPPFLAGS, so we put the include path in CFLAGS, too.
