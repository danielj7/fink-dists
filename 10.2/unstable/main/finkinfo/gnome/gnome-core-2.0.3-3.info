DescDetail: <<
In GNOME2, gnome-core package is divided into several packages. This
package doesn't install any files of itself, but helps user to upgrade
from GNOME1 to GNOME2.

You can remove this package after you have installed GNOME2.

DescPackaging: <<
This package only suggests gnome-desktop, gnome-panel, gnome-session and
gnome-terminal. We cannot depends on them, because these packages conflict
with old gnome-core, but old bundle-gnome depends on gnome-core, so we
should install these packages without removing gnome-core.
