Description: WWW BLAST
DescDetail: <<
This standalone WWW BLAST server suite of programs was designed similar to
the regular NCBI BLAST server and such command-line NCBI BLAST programs like
"blastall", "blastpgp", "rpsblast" and "megablast". It incorporates most
features, which exist in NCBI BLAST programs and should be relatively easy
to use. This server does not support any request queuing and load balancing.
As soon as the user hits a "Search" button, BLAST starts immediately if
entered information is valid. So, this server is not intended to handle
large load, which may exist in public service. Such queueing and
loadbalancing however may be implemented using such products as Load Sharing
Facility - "LSF" from Platform Computing Corporation. Interface to "LSF" was
implemented in NCBI, however this was not included in this suite. Standalone
server assumes that users have their own BLAST or RPS-BLAST database(s),
that should be searched and want to have a simple WWW interface to such
search. It is STRONLY recommended that user has experience in installation
and running standalone NCBI BLAST programs.

DescUsage: <<
****************************************
For %n to work, you must edit /etc/httpd/httpd.conf.
Uncomment the \"AddHandler cgi-script .cgi\" line.
Add the following two sections:

<Directory %p/share/%n>
    Options FollowSymLinks ExecCGI
    AllowOverride None
    Order allow,deny
    Allow from all
</Directory>

<VirtualHost *>
    ServerName blast.your.domain
    DocumentRoot %p/share/%n
</VirtualHost>

Also, you will have to add the host blast.your.domain to NetInfo.
You can do this through the NetInfo GUI or the shell. For example,
the following three lines will assign the name to your local host:
sudo niload hosts / <<EOF
127.0.0.1 blast.your.domain
EOF
where \"your.domain\" is the name of your domain.
Then restart apache:
sudo apachectl restart
****************************************
To demonstrate %n, point your browser to:
http://blast.your.domain/
****************************************
To make %n site specific, run:
%p/share/%n/config_setup.pl
You may manually download any formatted databases to /data/blastdb from:
ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/blast/db/FormattedDatabases/
