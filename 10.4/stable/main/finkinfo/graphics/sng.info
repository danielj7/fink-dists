# DISCLAIMER: Max Horn is the sole maintainer of this package.
# Please DO NOT MAKE MODIFICATIONS without informing the maintainer.
# Preferably, send a patch to me instead of making changes yourself!
# If that is not possible due to extra urgency, at least send me a mail.
#
# Explanation: I am sick and tired of getting back to my packages and
# discovering that people have messed with it. I am then forced to
# retrace their steps, find out who, when and why did make a certain
# change etc. -- i.e. it makes my life as maintainer harder.
# Furthermore, as maintainer I am responsible for problems caused by my
# packages. But I am not willing to take responsibility for something I
# did not do. In particular, for changes that other people introduced
# behind my back, no matter how good and noble their intentions were. As
# such, I may see myself forced to drop responsibility for (and hence,
# maintainership of) the affected package.

Description: Markup language for representing PNG contents
DescDetail: <<
 SNG (Scriptable Network Graphics) is a minilanguage designed
 specifically to represent the entire contents of a PNG
 (Portable Network Graphics) file in an editable form. Thus,
 SNGs representing elaborate graphics images and ancillary
 chunk data can be readily generated or modified using only
 text tools.

 SNG is implemented by a compiler/decompiler called sng that
 losslessly translates between SNG and PNG
<<
DescPort: Uses autoconf. Provided under the libpng/zlib license.
DescPackaging: <<
  The configure patch ensures that rgb.txt is found in more locations,
  in particular, that it is found on 10.5.
