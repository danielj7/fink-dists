  DescDetail: <<
KChart is the KOffice chart drawing application.  Use it to
embed charts into your KOffice documents, e.g. a report
written with KWord.

Easy to Use:

* default values for all parameters
* automatic ordinate axis computation based on
  highest/lowest data value
* default sizes (fonts, line widths...) relative to the
  window size

Highly Configurable:

* All of the parameters may be changed after
  configuring/drawing the chart.
* Size values (axis/grid line width, font sizes, bar width,
  dataset gap, pie chart radius ... ) may be specified in
  either absolute pixels or relative to the window size.
  This makes your chart layout-independent since such values
  are being recalculated automatically when the window
  dimensions have changed.

Flexible Layout:

* Legends may be centered at a chart edge or in a corner
  with the chart making way in vertical and/or in horizontal
  direction thus offering 16 legend/chart relationships to
  choose from
* Header and footer texts have special font type/size and
  color settings

Axes and Data:

* Automatical ordinate axis computation based on
  highest/lowest data value which can be easily replaced by
  programmer-defined start, end and delta value settings.
* Abscissa labels may be taken either from data cells
  containing the respective strings or from
  programmer-defined QStringLists or calculated
  automatically based on a format chosen by the user and
  values found in the cells
* Up to 8 axes: 2 left, 2 right, 2 top, 2 bottom
* A chart may have 2 different ordinates: e.g. left axis for
  series 1,2,3 right axis for data series 4
* Each axis may draw (sub-)grid lines using their own color,
  line width, style

Chart Combinations:

* sharing the same abscissa axis or using different ones
  (e.g Top and Bottom axis)
* sharing the same ordinate or using different ones (e.g
  Left and Right axis)
* Axes may use the same line color / line width as the bars
  (or the lines, resp.) which they belong to.

Chart Types:

* Bar: normal | stacked | percent, 2D | 3D-Look
* Line: normal | stacked | percent, 2D | 3D-Look, show
  marker: circle | square | diamond
* Area: normal | stacked | percent
* HiLo: normal | open-close
* Pie: normal | exploded | some exploded, 2D | 3D
* Ring: normal | exploded | some exploded, fixed
  thickness | relative thickness
* Polar: normal | stacked | percent

Kexi is an integrated data management application.  It can
be used for creating database schemas, inserting data,
performing queries, and processing data.  Forms can be
created to provide a custom interface to your data.  All
database objects - tables, queries and forms - are stored in
the database, making it easy to share data and design.

As a real member of the KDE and KOffice projects, Kexi
integrates fluently into both.

Kexi is considered as a long awaited Open Source competitor
for MS Access, Filemaker and Oracle Forms.  Its development
is motivated by the lack of Rapid Application Development
(RAD) tools for database systems that are sufficiently
powerful, inexpensive, open standards driven and portable
across many operating systems and hardware platforms.

KFormula is an easy to use formula editor.  It provides the
basic input facilities and the support functionality you
come to expect of a KOffice application.  Some of its most
exciting features are:

* Easy Greek letter insertion
* Intelligent cursor movement
* Advanced syntax highlighting
* Multi-level undo support
* LaTeX export (copy and paste into a text editor)

KFormula uses the KOffice formula drawing library.  If you
have to deal with many formulas you may wish to use a
KFormula object embedded in KWord or KSpread.

Kugar is a KDE tool for generating business quality reports
which can be viewed and printed.  It includes a standalone
report viewer and a KPart report viewer.  The latter means
that any KDE application can embed the report viewing
functionality and that reports can be viewed using the
Konqueror browser.

Kugar works by merging application generated data with a
template to produce the final report.  Both the data and the
template are specified using XML.  This approach means that
applications only need worry about generating the data
itself.  A template can be referenced via a URL which allows
businesses to create a centrally managed template library.

Features include:

* Kugar report designer.
* Report printing in Postscript.
* Database/datasource neutral, data is supplied to the
  report engine in XML.
* Support for direct database access.
* Open report definition files, report layout is stored in
  XML.
* Full control of fonts, colors, text alignment and
  wrapping.
* Report Header/Footer.
* Page Header/Footer.
* Detail Section.
* Detail Header/Footer.
* Unlimited number of detail levels.
* Grand totals: count, sum, average, variance and standard
  deviation.
* Additional formatting (negative numbers, currency, commas
  for numbers and dates).

amounts of texts and allows you to do professional markup
with ease.

KWord's features include:

* paragraph style sheets (borders, alignment, spacing,
  indentation, bullet points, tab stops, page breaks, and
  font type, style, color and size), together with a stylist
  to edit, add, remove and update styles (a number of
  predefined styles are provided);
* a frame orientation, suitable for simple desktop
  publishing (DTP);
* numerous preset as well as custom page sizes;
* multiple columns per page;
* headers and footers (including different first page
  headers/footers);
* variables, such as page number, company name, user name,
  document summary, date and time or a custom variable;
* tables;
* embedding of text frames, images and clip-art (.wmf and
  .svg files);
* chapter numbering;
* auto-generation of table of contents;
* auto-correction and spell checking
* templates

DescUsage: <<
---[ Installation ]---------------------------------------------------

To install all of the official KDE packages, install "bundle-kde" or
"bundle-kde-ssl" (depending on whether crypotgraphic laws permit
downloading strong cryptography).  Unless you have a specific reason
not to, "bundle-kde-ssl" is suggested.

---[ Configuration ]--------------------------------------------------

To use KDE as your windowing system in XDarwin, create a file called
".xinitrc" in your home directory, containing the following line:

  /sw/bin/startkde >/tmp/kde.log 2>&1

See http://fink.sourceforge.net/doc/x11/run-xfree86.php#xinitrc
for more information on the xinitrc files and how they work.

If you want to use Apple's X11 instead of the KDE window manager,
put the following line before the startkde line in .xinitrc:

  export KDEWM=quartz-wm

Note that depending on your version of Apple's X11, this can cause
strange resizing issues with the kicker (KDE task bar).

---[ Startup ]--------------------------------------------------------

Once you have created an ~/.xinitrc file, you should be able to start
KDE by clicking on the "XDarwin" icon in your Applications folder.  

NOTE: By default, X11 on Mac OS X runs in "rootless" mode, generally.
If you run KDE in rootless mode, it will take over your desktop with
a window that covers everything up.  You can remove this by disabling
desktop icons in the KDE control center.  Open the control center
(either from the "K" menu bar, or by typing "kcontrol" in an xterm)
then expand the "Desktop" list, click "Behavior", and uncheck the
"Show icons on desktop" checkbox.
   
---[ Removal ]--------------------------------------------------------
   
To remove all of the official KDE packages, you can remove the KDE
libraries and anything that depends on them by running, in a terminal:
   
  sudo apt-get remove kdelibs3-ssl-shlibs kdelibs3-shlibs

To remove an individual KDE package collection (like kdenetwork3 or
kdesdk3) you can generally remove [package]-base.  For example, to
remove all of the kdenetwork3 packages, run:

  sudo apt-get remove kdenetwork3-base
