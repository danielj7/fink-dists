Description: Molecular Biology Open Software Suite
DescDetail: <<
EMBOSS is a free Open Source software analysis package specially
developed for the needs of the molecular biology (e.g. EMBnet) user
community. The software automatically copes with data in a variety of
formats and even allows transparent retrieval of sequence data from the
web. Also, as extensive libraries are provided with the package, it is a
platform to allow other scientists to develop and release software in
true open source spirit. EMBOSS also integrates a range of currently
available packages and tools for sequence analysis into a seamless whole.

DescUsage: <<
See the README file for other environment variables you may need to configure. 
PLPLOT_LIB is already set by fink in /sw/etc/profile.d/.
script. See http://www.uk.embnet.org/Software/EMBOSS/Jemboss/readme.html
for information on using the Jemboss GUI for EMBOSS. 
<<
DescPackaging: <<
The package uses shared libraries, but does not install the headers.
Thus I have not made a splitoff for the libraries since they are not
useful. This may be changed in future versions per the developers.
