DescDetail: <<
XTide is a package that provides tide and current predictions in a wide 
variety of formats.  Graphs, text listings, and calendars can be generated, or
a tide clock can be provided on your desktop.

XTide can work with X-windows, plain text terminals, or the web.  This is 
accomplished with three separate programs:  the interactive interface (xtide),
the non-interactive or command line interface (tide), and the web interface 
(xttpd).

The algorithm that XTide uses to predict tides is the one used by the National
Ocean Service in the U.S.  It is significantly more accurate than the simple 
tide clocks that can be bought in novelty stores.  However, it takes more to 
predict tides accurately than just a spiffy algorithm--you also need some 
special data for each and every location for which you want to predict tides.  
XTide reads these data from harmonics files.  See 
http://www.flaterco.com/xtide/files.html for details on where to get one.

Ultimately, XTide's predictions can only be as good as the available harmonics
data.  Due to issues of data availability and of compatibility with non-U.S.
tide systems, the predictions for U.S. locations tend to be a lot better on 
average than those for locations outside of the U.S.  It is up to you to 
verify that the predictions for your locale match up acceptably well with the
officially sanctioned ones.

Deviations of 1 minute from official predictions are typical for U.S. 
locations having the latest data.
Deviations of 20 minutes are typical for non-U.S. locations or U.S. locations
that are using obsolete data.
Much longer deviations indicate a problem.
<<
DescUsage: <<
The xttpd daemon must be run as nobody.  You can do this via

sudo -u nobody xttpd <port number>

replacing <port number> by the port you want to use.  
You can also set it up to run at bootup via 

daemonic enable xttpd

To change the default port and/or the website feedback address, edit
/Library/StartupItems//Library/StartupItems/daemonic-xttpd/daemonic-xttpd
as a superuser, and alter the command after "#run the daemon" appropriately, 
e.g. change

	"/sw/sbin/xttpd 8000"

to

	"env XTTPD_FEEDBACK=me@mymail.com /sw/sbin/xttpd MYPORT"
<<
DescPackaging: <<
	Uses flag-sort to keep the include flags in the right order.

	Avoid the X11 convenience symlinks on 10.8.

	Update internals to point to our location for xtide.conf.
	Does not build with clang on 10.8 and earlier.
	
	2.12.1-1:	Because we hardcode the harmonic file version in the configuration file,
				we need to make sure that the setup in this package is in sync with
				the xtide-harmonic* packages--use the Type: harm field to make updating
				this easier.
	
	2.11-4: Now patched to look for %p/etc/xtide.conf.  Set up a default
			version of that which points to the right places.
			
			xttpd now built as nobody (the real nobody, not fink's
			"nobody special") and must be run as nobody.  It can be
			run at startup via daemonic
	
	2.11-2: Dispense with the wrapper script.  Set HFILE_PATH in _this_ package.  
	Also set WVS_DIR here, too.
	
	2.11-1: Use a wrapper script for the executables that reads Fink's environment 
	(for 10.4 and 10.5 X11) as well as setting the HFILE_PATH variable based on
	any user setting and whether xtide-harmonics-us and xtide-harmonics-non-us are 
	installed.
