Package: t1lib5-shlibs
Version: 5.1.1
Revision: 2
Type: bundle
Depends: t1lib5-x11-shlibs, t1lib5-nox-shlibs
Description: Placeholder for t1lib5-*-shlibs
DescPackaging: <<
 The shared libraries for t1lib5 have now been split into two separate
 packages: t1lib5-x11-shlibs and t1lib5-nox-shlibs.

 This bundle package exists to satisfy the requirements of the Shlibs
 field from the previous t1lib5-shlibs package, which guaranteed that
 both shared libraries would always be available from a package called
 "t1lib5-shlibs".
