Description: Preprocessor for building GTK+ Objects (v2)
DescDetail: <<
  GTK Object Builder 2 (GOB2) is a simple preprocessor for easily creating GTK
  objects. It reads a class description file with inline C code and produces
  .c and .h object files for you. It allows you to easily use all of the
  features of the GTK object system and avoids typos by reducing the amount
  of code needed. In general, the amount of code is about the same as for
  OO languages such as Java or C++, but you still have to only use C and
  you get all the power of the GTK object system.
