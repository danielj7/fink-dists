Description: Java Connector Architecture
DescDetail: <<
The J2EE Connector architecture provides a Java solution to
the problem of connectivity between the many application servers
and EISs already in existence.  By using the J2EE Connector
architecture, EIS vendors no longer need to customize their
product for each application server.  Application server vendors
who conform to the J2EE Connector architecture do not need to add
custom code whenever they want to add connectivity to a new EIS.

The J2EE Connector architecture defines a standard architecture
for connecting the J2EE platform to heterogeneous EISs.  Examples
of EISs include ERP, mainframe transaction processing, database
systems, and legacy applications not written in the Java
programming language.  By defining a a set of scalable, secure,
and transactional mechanisms, the J2EE Connector architecture
enables the integration of EISs with application servers and
enterprise applications.
