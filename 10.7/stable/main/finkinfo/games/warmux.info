Description: Worms clone
DescDetail: <<
War is declared !

Have the mascots of your favorite free softwares battle in the Warmux
arena. Using dynamite, grenades, baseball bat and others bazookas,...
exterminate your opponent in a 2D toon style scenery and a funny
environment.

Each player controls the team of his choice (penguin, gnu, firefox,
wilber,...) and must destroy his adversary using more or less casual
weapons.

Although a minimum of strategy is required to vanquish, Warmux is
pre-eminently a "convivial mass murder" game where, turn by turn,
each member of each team attempts to produce a maximum of damage to
his opponents.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
InstallScript calls the install script twice because the first run always fails.  We silence the failure with || true and then re-run it.  No dire effects have been noticed from this system.
<<
DescPort: <<
We're not an .app, so use standard config file locations.  #if is swallowing the file location chunk. Move it outside in patch.
