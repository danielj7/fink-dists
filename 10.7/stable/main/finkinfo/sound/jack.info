Description: Low-latency audio server
DescDetail: <<
 The Jack Audio Connection Kit is a low-latency audio server, written for 
 POSIX conferment operating systems. It can connect a number of different 
 applications  to an audio device, as well as allowing them to share audio 
 between themselves. Its clients can run in their own processes (ie. as normal 
 applications), or can they can run within the JACK server (ie. as a "plugin").
 
 JACK was designed from the ground up for professional audio work, and its 
 design focuses on two key areas: synchronous execution of all clients, and 
 low latency operation.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
 The JACK shared libraries arn't very useful without the jack server 
 contained in the main package.
 
 For some odd reason --disable-alsa, so causes it to also not find libsndfile.
<<
DescPort: <<
 Fix -framework flags in jack.pc. See:
