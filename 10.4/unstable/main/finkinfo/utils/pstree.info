Description: Show 'ps' process list as hierarchical tree
DescDetail: <<
 pstree is a small program that shows the process-listing as a tree (as
 the name implies), akin to the Activity Monitor's hierarchical process
 view in 10.3. It has several options to make selection criteria and to
 change the output style.
