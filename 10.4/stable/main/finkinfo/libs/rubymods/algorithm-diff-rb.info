# Additional Data:
DescDetail: <<
This implementation is basically a Ruby conversion of the Perl
Algorithm::Diff module in CPAN.

Diff is an algorithm which computes the differences between two
lists a and b. The resulting set of differences can be applied to
a (also called "patching") to get b. This is also what the Unix
command line tools "diff" and "patch" are able to do.

diff.rb generates a "minimal diff". This means that the set of
changes that should be applied to a to get b can not be fewer than
those generated by diff.rb. diff.rb does not generate contextual
diffs. Therefor, the diff can only be succesfully applied to a
list exactly equal to to original a.
