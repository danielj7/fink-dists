Description: Menu-driven tool to create graphical objects (old version)
DescPort: <<
 We don't need xpm since it is already in XFree86 4.1.  There is a
 small problem with the makefile so one of the make targets is done by
 hand in the compile script.

 There have been reports that this package does not compile succesfully when
 xtools is intalled rather than xfree86.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
 XFIGLIBDIR was set to %p/share/xfig.  Looks in /etc/printcap
 for printer descriptions, which may not be correct for darwin or OS X.
 Also, "make install" creates some empty directories in the /usr and /etc
 trees so we remove them. 
<<
DescUsage: <<
 The environment variable XAPPLRESDIR must point to  
 /sw/etc/app-defaults when using this package.  (This happens by default 
 if /sw/bin/init.* is sourced, thanks to the app-defaults package.) The
 user can also specify "*customization: -color" in the .Xdefaults or
 .Xresources file, to take advantage of the color support which was
 compiled in.
