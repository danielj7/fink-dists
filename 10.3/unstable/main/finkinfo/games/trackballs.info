Description: Marble Madness Clone
DescDetail: <<
Trackballs is a simple game similar to the classical game Marble
Madness on the Amiga in the 80's. By steering a marble ball through a
labyrinth filled with vicious hammers, pools of acid and other
obstacles the player collects points. When the ball reaches the
destination it continues to the next, more difficult track - unless
the time runs out.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
  dmacks:
    patched configure and src/Makefile.in to pass all local -I before
    any system-wide ones.

    overhauled installIcons to understand destdir vs prefix

    patched installation to set group flags during PostInst instead of
    'make install' so that build is clean under --build-as-nobody and
    adjusted so that high scores file is persistent and writable
