DescDetail: <<
Pybliographer is a tool for managing bibliographic databases. It can
be used for searching, editing, reformatting, etc. In fact, it's a
simple framework that provides easy to use python classes and
functions, and therefore can be extended to many uses (generating HTML
pages according to bibliographic searches, etc).  In addition to the
scripting environment, a graphical Gnome interface is available. It
provides powerful editing capabilities, a nice hierarchical search
mechanism, direct insertion of references into LyX and Kile, direct
queries on Medline, and more. It currently supports the following file
formats: BibTeX, ISI, Medline, Ovid, Refer.
