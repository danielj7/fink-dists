# DISCLAIMER: Max Horn is the sole maintainer of this package.
# Please DO NOT MAKE MODIFICATIONS without informing the maintainer.
# Preferably, send a patch to me instead of making changes yourself!
# If that is not possible due to extra urgency, at least send me a mail.
#
# Explanation: I am sick and tired of getting back to my packages and
# discovering that people have messed with it. I am then forced to
# retrace their steps, find out who, when and why did make a certain
# change etc. -- i.e. it makes my life as maintainer harder.
# Furthermore, as maintainer I am responsible for problems caused by my
# packages. But I am not willing to take responsibility for something I
# did not do. In particular, for changes that other people introduced
# behind my back, no matter how good and noble their intentions were. As
# such, I may see myself forced to drop responsibility for (and hence,
# maintainership of) the affected package.

Description: Shared library build helper, v2.x
DescDetail: <<
GNU libtool knows how to build shared libraries on a wide range of
platforms. It is designed to work with autoconf to add painless shared
library support to GNU packages.

libtool-2.x is a major change from libtool-1.5. On darwin shared
libraries built with this version will have only one symlink
libfoo.dylib -> libfoo.2.dylib, not two links like on branch-1-5.
There are many many major changes in this version, and very likely
some bugs, please let me know if you come across any.
<<
DescPort: <<
Uses a 'g' prefix to avoid a naming conflict with Apple's libtool
program (which is completely unrelated).

The PatchScript fixes some of the autoconf tests libtool provides
to not output spurious warnings when Apple's compilers choose to
generate conftest.dSYM directories. This affects many 3rd party
packages using libtool.
