Description:  Phylogeny and sequence data management
DescDetail: <<
The ARB software is a graphically oriented package comprising various tools 
for sequence 
database handling and data analysis. A central database of processed 
(aligned) sequences
and any type of additional data linked to the respective sequence entries is 
structured 
according to phylogeny or other user defined criteria.

NOTE: This version is an experimental beta and is not an official release of
ARB!
<<
DescUsage: <<
ARB works, but the PT_server and "fast save" will NOT work on an HFS+ volume. 
The current fix is to specify your PT_server directory on a UFS disk. 
A UFS disk image can be used for this purpose.
The default dir is /sw/share/arb/lib/pts/ - symlink this to a writable UFS 
image.
Future revisions, this limitation can hopefully be patched around.

Note: The help is currently broken. Disabled.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
bin/count conflicts with the "count" in the afni package. If anyone needs 
both, let me know
and I can work around the conflict.
<<
DescPort: <<
ARB does NOT work with lesstif - many images do not display. Thus depends on 
openmotif.
Many patches. Shared libraries not building correctly, so i have them building 
static. 
It wants them in its own lib directory. See the patches to the Makefile. 
Thanks to Mike Dyall-Smith for the help in testing this.

Rev 0603:
- Remove ldd from AISC makefile
- Add sys/param.h for MAXPATH
- Help disabled due to incompatible libsablot version in fink
