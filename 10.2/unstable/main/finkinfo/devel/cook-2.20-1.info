DescDetail: <<
Cook is a very powerful and very easy to use replacement for make. 
Through the use of Cook's powerful description language, and it's many built 
in functions, sophisticated build can be easily accomplished.
Cook supports file fingerprints to speed build times, and also supports 
parallel builds over a network without requiring contorted build rules.
