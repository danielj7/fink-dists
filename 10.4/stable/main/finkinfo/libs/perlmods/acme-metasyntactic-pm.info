DescUsage: <<
	%p/bin/meta is a front-end utility program.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
	Scrap a test that fails because it wipes @INC and then can't
	find perl core modules. Duh.

	Scrap tests that require network access.

	Scrap tests that fail due to warnings about assuming default
	encoding values that doesn't seem to have visible effect on
	reading the pod. If anyone has visible effects, could backport
	changes from upstream newer versions.
