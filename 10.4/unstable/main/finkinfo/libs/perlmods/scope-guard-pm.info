Description: Lexically scoped resource management
DescDetail: <<
  This module provides a convenient way to perform cleanup or other forms
  of resource management at the end of a scope. It is particularly useful
  when dealing with exceptions: the Scope::Guard constructor takes a ref-
  erence to a subroutine that is guaranteed to be called even if the
  thread of execution is aborted prematurely. This effectively allows
  lexically-scoped "promises" to be made that are automatically honoured
  by perl's garbage collector.
