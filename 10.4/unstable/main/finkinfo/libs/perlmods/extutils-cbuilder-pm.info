DescDetail: <<
This module can build the C portions of Perl modules by invoking the
appropriate compilers and linkers in a cross-platform manner.  It was
motivated by the "Module::Build" project, but may be useful for other
purposes as well.  However, it is not intended as a general
cross-platform interface to all your C building needs.  That would
have been a much more ambitious goal!

	Former maintainer: Blair Zajac <blair@orcaware.com>

	Hack determination of abs path to perl interp ($^X may rely on
	$PATH rather than relative to $PWD)

	Fink is completely single-arch but apple's perl is so fat it
	even propagates multiple -arch flags via its Config.pm. Well
	not to us it won't, by golly.
