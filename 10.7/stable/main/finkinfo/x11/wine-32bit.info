# Trevor writes:
# According to the Wine README, any GCC higher than 2.7.2 should work, but only GCC 4.x has been tested.
# See Wine's documentation/PACKAGING file for more details about dependencies.
# I may have gone overboard on these dependencies, but better safe than sorry.
# Sjors writes:
# http://wiki.winehq.org/Wine64 describes that for building x86-64,
# gcc >= 4.5.1 is required.

DescDetail: <<
Wine is a translation layer (a program loader) capable of running Windows
applications on Linux and other POSIX compatible operating systems. Windows
programs running in Wine act as native programs would, running without the
performance or memory usage penalties of an emulator, with a similar look and
feel to other applications on your desktop.
<<
DescUsage: <<
The ~/.wine directory is supposed to be created and set up automatically the
first time you launch Wine. However, I have experienced "wineserver: could not
save registry branch" errors during the initial launch. To fix this problem,
run wineprefixcreate before launching Wine. This should create the ~/.wine
directory and populate it with the necessary files. You may still see error
messages, but the directory will be created. For example:

  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=%p/lib
  %p/bin/wineprefixcreate

This only needs to be done once.

It will also warn that wine-gecko is missing during the first launch and ask
to download it. Click "Install" to continue.

For a quick test of Wine, run %p/bin/notepad

For best results install an update X server such as XQuartz from
http://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/wiki

This is the development version of wine. For stable please install wine-stable.
