DescDetail: <<
FindBugs is a program to find bugs in Java programs.  It looks for
instances of "bug patterns" --- code instances that are likely to be
errors.

Changes since version 1.1.3

 * In null pointer analysis, try to be better about always showing two
   locations: where it is known null and where it is dereferenced.
 * Interprocedural analysis of which methods return nonnull values
 * Use method calls to select order in which classes are analyzed, and
   order in which methods are analyzed, to improve interprocedural
   analysis results.
 * Significant improvements in memory footprint, memory allocation and
   CPU utilization (20-30% reduction in all three)
 * Added a project name, to provide better descriptions in the HTML
   output.
 * Stopped reporting transient fields of classes not marked as
   serializable. Transient is used by other persistence frameworks.
 * Improvements to detector for SQL injection (Thanks to Matt Hargett
   for his contributions
 * Changed open/save options in GUI2 to not distinguish between
   FindBugs projects and saved FindBugs analysis results.
 * Improvements to detection of serious non-short-circuit evaluation.

Findbugs itself is release under the LGPL, however the shell scripts that
launch the program contain some code subject to the Apache Software
License.

This is why I've set the License field to OSI-Approved
