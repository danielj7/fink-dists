Package: vroot-h
Version: 1.4.1jwz
Revision: 1
Description: Virtual root window handling header file
DescDetail: <<
This header file redefines the X11 macros RootWindow and DefaultRootWindow,
making them look for a virtual root window as provided by certain `virtual'
window managers like swm and tvtwm. If none is found, the ordinary root
window is returned, thus retaining backward compatibility with standard
window managers.
<<
DescUsage: <<
Include the header file as <vroot.h> or <X11/vroot.h> and pass 
"-I/sw/include/vroot" to your compiler.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
I can't find a simple dist of either this header or a *small* full
program that uses it, so the file is copied from xscreensaver (4.08)
and brought into Fink as a .patch.
<<
DescPort: <<
Install in a subdir of include so that its use isn't automatic.
Perhaps some packages have ./configure that checks for vroot.h,
which will make these have different binaries depending on if
vroot.h is found. So we'll install in include/vroot so package
maintainers can affirmatively choose to use it if they so desire.
