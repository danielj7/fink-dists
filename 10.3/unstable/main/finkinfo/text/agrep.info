Description: Flexible egrep/fregrep replacement
DescDetail: <<
The three most significant features of agrep that are not supported by
the grep family are 
1) the ability to search for approximate patterns;
for example, "agrep -2 homogenos foo" will find homogeneous as well 
as any other word that can be obtained from homogenos with at most 
2 substitutions, insertions, or deletions.
"agrep -B homogenos foo" will generate a message of the form
best match has 2 errors, there are 5 matches, output them? (y/n)

2) agrep is record oriented rather than just line oriented;  a record
is by default a line, but it can be user defined;
for example, "agrep -d '^From ' 'pizza' mbox"
outputs all mail messages that contain the keyword "pizza".
Another example:  "agrep -d '$$' pattern foo" will output all
paragraphs (separated by an empty line) that contain pattern.

3) multiple patterns with AND (or OR) logic queries.
For example, "agrep -d '^From ' 'burger,pizza' mbox"
outputs all mail messages containing at least one of the
two keywords (, stands for OR).
"agrep -d '^From ' 'good;pizza' mbox" outputs all mail messages
containing both keywords.
