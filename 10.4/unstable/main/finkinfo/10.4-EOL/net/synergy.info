Description: Share keyboard, mouse between machines
# Copied from the README:
DescDetail: <<
 Synergy lets you easily share a single mouse and keyboard between
 multiple computers with different operating systems, each with its
 own display, without special hardware.  It's intended for users
 with multiple computers on their desk since each system uses its
 own display.
<<
DescUsage: <<
 After installing, see http://synergy2.sourceforge.net/running.html
 and start at Step 3. In short: copy %p/share/doc/synergy/synergy.conf
 to ~/.synergy and edit.  Then, run "synergys -d ERROR -c ~/.synergy".
 On other machines, run "synergyc <servername>".
<<
DescPort: <<
 It would be great to have a daemonic description to run the server
 and/or client.  I'll happily accept help on that front.  Perhaps a
 standard %p/etc/synergy.conf location would be appropriate in that
 case?
