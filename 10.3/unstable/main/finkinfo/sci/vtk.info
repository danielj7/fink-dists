Description: The Visualization ToolKit
DescDetail: << 
The Visualization ToolKit (VTK) is an open source, freely available software
system for 3D computer graphics, image processing, and visualization used by
thousands of researchers and developers around the world. VTK consists of a
C++ class library, and several interpreted interface layers including
Tcl/Tk, Java, and Python. 

VTK supports a wide variety of visualization algorithms including scalar,
vector, tensor, texture, and volumetric methods; and advanced modeling
techniques such as implicit modelling, polygon reduction, mesh smoothing,
cutting, contouring, and Delaunay triangulation. In addition, dozens of
imaging algorithms have been directly integrated to allow the user to mix 2D
imaging / 3D graphics algorithms and data. The design and implementation of
the library has been strongly influenced by object-oriented principles. VTK
has been installed and tested on nearly every Unix-based platform, PCs
(Windows 98/ME/NT/2000/XP), and Mac OSX Jaguar or later.
<<
DescUsage: <<
 This version uses X11 and Fink's Tcl/Tk.
 Examples are provided in the share/doc/vtk/Examples folder.
 To run them, use "vtk Tutorial/Step1/Tcl/Cone.tcl", for example. 
 For some of them, you need the vtkdata package.
 For documentation see the vtk web site. 
<<
DescPort: <<
 Installs into /sw/lib/vtk-4.2 and /sw/include/vtk-4.2, in order
 to be compatible with vtk version 4.4 (package vtk-py23).
 Java wrapper disabled in this version. It may be added when 
 I had more time for testing.
 Python wrapper disabled, too. It doesn't work.
 The dylibs are created with compat version 0.0.0, because I don't know
 how to teach the cmake build system about compatibility versions.
 It is bad enough already to get them a decent install_name.
