Package: fltk-x11
Version: 1.1.7
Revision: 1002
Description: GUI toolkit
DescDetail: <<
FLTK (pronounced "fulltick") is a cross-platform C++ GUI toolkit for
UNIX/Linux (X11), Microsoft Windows, and MacOS X. FLTK provides modern
GUI functionality without the bloat and supports 3D graphics via
OpenGL and its built-in GLUT emulation.

FLTK also includes an excellent UI builder called FLUID that can be
used to create applications in minutes.

DescUsage: <<
Documentation is available on the website, or in the installed
manpages and HTML.

DescPort: <<
When `uname` is Darwin will try to link against Carbon, and use Quartz
or QuickDraw graphics. To force x11, remove case that sets Darwin
Carbon compiler flags (so fall through to unix/xll) and that sets
config.h flags to use Apple-specific graphics. HFS+ is not case
sensitive, but there is an important variable (HLINKS) involving this
that is set in the same case blocks, so factor out the setting of that
variable.

Sylvain says to undefine __APPLE__, a practice which I reluctantly
continue for now. This flag affects many features, some of which are
FS-dependent (similar to HLINKS) and others are Carbon-vs-x11 issues.
The use of -U is especially bad since this setting may propagate (via
bin/fltk-config) to programs compiled against fltk which may use that
token for other platform issues but if it doesn't then fltk headers
may give incorrect behavior (it is -D but library was built with it
-U). Actions should be made based on (tokens resulting from) specific
feature-related checks. I haven't had a chance to go through every
occurance to see what the desired behavior is in each case.

Patch Makefile to not build test programs.

Patch test/colbrowser for OS X location of rgb.txt.

Patch to show actual compiling commands, not synopses of them.

Don't continue if any make target fails.

Patch to avoid chmod +x on libraries.

DescPackaging: <<
We need different packages for different XFree86 versions. If >=4.3 then
libfltk must link against libfontconfig (thanks Jerry Talkington), but
if 4.2 then there is no libfontconfig. By 10.3, we're all up to 4.3;
drop the special handling and Provides mess, just have real fltk-x11.

Installing preformatted manpages makes the package difficult to remove
cleanly (presence of man/cat? causes `man` to populate it). No need to
install them since we also install the sources.
