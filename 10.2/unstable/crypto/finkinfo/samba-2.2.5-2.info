Description: SMB and CIFS client and server for UNIX
DescDetail: <<
 Samba is a free SMB and CIFS client and server for UNIX. This install of
samba has both ssl and cups support
<<
DescUsage: <<
 Samba settings are set in the configuration file 'smb.conf'. installed in
yourfinkdirectory/etc/samba.

 To enable this version of Samba instead of the version installed with 10.2
do the following;

 1. Backup the default 10.2 Samba startupitem found in /System/Library
/StartupItems, incase ever needed.

 2. Replace the default 10.2 Samba startupitem with the startupitem found
in yourfinkdirectory/share/samba/StartupItems. Please note if you have
fink installed outside of the default 'sw' you will have to edit the
startupitem to point it towards your fink install.
 
 3.Finally highlight "Windows File Sharing" in the System Preferences,
"Sharing" under the "Services" tab and press "Start".

 To enable Swat do the following;

1. Add the following line to "/etc/inetd.conf";
"swat  stream  tcp  nowait  root  /sw/sbin/swat  swat" and

2. Add the following line to "/etc/services"; "swat  901/tcp", reboot then

3. Open your favourite web browser and point it at http://localhost:901/

DescPackaging: <<
Patch provided by David Morrison to fix a bug where a directory is created
in the fink prefix outside of dpkg when installing, also since 10.2 doesn't
come with the cups header files and they are required during building we
include our own, samba requires a small patch to find these.
