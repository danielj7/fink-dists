Description: Django - the Web framework for perfectionists with deadlines

DescDetail: <<
Django is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development
and clean, pragmatic design.

Developed and used over two years by a fast-moving online-news operation,
Django was designed to handle two challenges: the intensive deadlines of a
newsroom and the stringent requirements of the experienced Web developers who
wrote it. It lets you build high-performing, elegant Web applications quickly.
<<

DescUsage:<<
See http://www.djangoproject.com/documentation/
<<

DescPort:<<
docutils needs to be changed slightly to export its Python code to other
applications. As a result, the documentation in the admin interface does not
work.

The install script was cribbed from setuptools-py.info.
