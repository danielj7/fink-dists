Revision: 2
Distribution: 10.4, 10.5
Description: FUSE filesystem for zip archives
DescDetail: <<
	fuse-zip is a FUSE file system to navigate, extract, create and modify
	ZIP archives based in libzip implemented in C++.
	
	With fuse-zip you really can work with ZIP archives as real directories.
	Unlike KIO or Gnome VFS, it can be used in any application without
	modifications.
	
	Unlike other FUSE filesystems, only fuse-zip provides write support to ZIP
	archives. Also, fuse-zip is faster that all known implementations on large
	archives with many files.
<<
DescUsage: <<
	fuse-zip <zip-file> [fusermount options]
	
	Example:
		mkdir /Volumes/zip
		fuse-zip azipfile.zip /Volumes/zip -ovolname="zip"
		
	To unmount the archive use:
	    umount /Volumes/zip
		
	Note: doesn't preserve extended attributes.
