DescDetail: <<
FindBugs is a program to find bugs in Java programs.  It looks for
instances of "bug patterns" --- code instances that are likely to be
errors.

Changes since verson 0.9.3:

  * Substantial rework of datamining code
  * Removed bogus warnings about await on things other than Condition
    not being in a loop
  * Fixed bug in OpcodeStack handling of dup2 of long/double values
  * Don't report array types as missing classes
  * Adjustment of some warnings on ignored return values
  * Added thread safety annotations from Java Concurrency in Practice
    (no detectors written for these yet)
  * Added annotation for methods that, if overridden, should be
    invoked by overriding methods via a call to super
  * Updated -html:fancy.xsl (Etienne Giraudy)

Findbugs itself is release under the LGPL, however the shell scripts that
launch the program contain some code subject to the Apache Software
License.

This is why I've set the License field to OSI-Approved
