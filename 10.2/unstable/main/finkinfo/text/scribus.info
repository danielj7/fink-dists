Description: Layout program
DescDetail: <<
Scribus is a Layout program for Linux., similar to Adobe PageMaker[tm], 
QuarkXPress[tm] or Adobe InDesign[tm], except that it is published under 
the GNU GPL. 

Currently, it is still in its early stages of development, but rapidly
maturing and very useable. Already, it has the ability to layout
newsletters, create corporate stationery, small posters and other
documents which need flexible layout and/or the ability to output to
professional quality imagesetting equipment. You can do all the
typical tasks like placing and rotating text and/or images on a page,
specify manual kerning of type and much more.

While the goals of the program are for ease of use and simple easy to
understand tools, Scribus offers support for professional publishing
features, such as CMYK color, easy PDF creation, Encapsulated
Postscript import/export and creation of color separations.

Graphic formats which can be placed include Ecapsulated Post Script
(eps), Joint Photographic Experts Group (jpeg), Portable Network
Graphics (png) and XPixMap(xpm) 
<<
DescUsage: <<
 The English documentation and samples packages are not included
 in this version. They are contained in separate packages.
<<
DescPort: <<
 The Makefile needs some help for the final linking.
 Plugin compiling overrides some libtool logic, but this is simpler
 than to import the whole KDE admin directory packet.
 The declaration of error disagreed with the one of dlerror in dlfcn.h 
 from dlcompat.
 The Little CMS library lcms is now required.
 freetype2 is required, because the configure script seems not to be
 happy with the freetype-config from X11.
 This version has a patch for the Bus Error problem when LANG is set.
 libart2 is now used for 2D graphics. There is an endian bug somewhere
 that gives wrong colors for included pictures.
