Package: libjpeg-turbo
Version: 1.2.0
Revision: 1
Description: High speed libjpeg for i386 and x86_64
DescDetail: <<
	libjpeg-turbo is a high-speed version of libjpeg for x86 and x86-64
	processors which uses SIMD instructions (MMX, SSE2, etc.) to accelerate
	baseline JPEG compression and decompression. libjpeg-turbo is generally
	2-4x as fast as the unmodified version of libjpeg, all else being
	equal.

	libjpeg-turbo was originally based on libjpeg/SIMD by Miyasaka Masaru,
	but the TigerVNC and VirtualGL projects made numerous enhancements to
	the codec, including improved support for Mac OS X, 64-bit support,
	support for 32-bit and big endian pixel formats (RGBA, ABGR, etc.),
	accelerated Huffman encoding/decoding, and various bug fixes. The goal
	was to produce a fully open source codec that could replace the
	partially closed source TurboJPEG/IPP codec used by VirtualGL and
	TurboVNC. libjpeg-turbo generally achieves 80-120% of the performance
	of TurboJPEG/IPP. It is faster in some areas but slower in others.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
	libjpeg-turbo is API/ABI compatible with libjpeg and can be used anywhere
	libjpeg.62.dylib is used. It's buried in %p/lib/%n to avoid 
	conflicts so packages need to be told to look there to use it.
	
	libjpeg-turbo works on powerpc, but doesn't get any speedup over
	regular libjpeg.
