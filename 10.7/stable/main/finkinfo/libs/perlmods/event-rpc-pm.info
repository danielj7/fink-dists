Description: Event based transparent Client/Server RPC

DescDetail: <<
Event::RPC supports you in developing Event based networking
client/server applications with transparent object/method access from
the client to the server. Network communication is optionally encrypted
using IO::Socket::SSL. Several event loop managers are supported due to
an extensible API. Currently Event and Glib are implemented.
