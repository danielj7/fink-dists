# DISCLAIMER: Max Horn is the sole maintainer of this package.
# Please DO NOT MAKE MODIFICATIONS without informing the maintainer.
# Preferably, send a patch to me instead of making changes yourself!
# If that is not possible due to extra urgency, at least send me a mail.
#
# Explanation: I am sick and tired of getting back to my packages and
# discovering that people have messed with it. I am then forced to
# retrace their steps, find out who, when and why did make a certain
# change etc. -- i.e. it makes my life as maintainer harder.
# Furthermore, as maintainer I am responsible for problems caused by my
# packages. But I am not willing to take responsibility for something I
# did not do. In particular, for changes that other people introduced
# behind my back, no matter how good and noble their intentions were. As
# such, I may see myself forced to drop responsibility for (and hence,
# maintainership of) the affected package.

Description: Lib for arithmetic and algebraic computations
DescDetail: <<
Givaro is a C++ library for arithmetic and algebraic computations.
Its main features are implementations of the basic arithmetic of many
mathematical entities: Primes fields, Extensions Fields, Finite Fields,
Finite Rings, Polynomials, Algebraic numbers, Arbitrary precision
integers and rationals (C++ wrappers over gmp) It also provides
data-structures and templated classes for the manipulation of basic
algebraic objects, such as vectors, matrices (dense, sparse,
structured), univariate polynomials (and therefore recursive
multivariate).
