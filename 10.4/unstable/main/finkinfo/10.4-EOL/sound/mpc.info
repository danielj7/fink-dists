Description: Command line Music Player Daemon (mpd) client
DescDetail: <<
This provides a command line client for the Music Player Daemon (mpd). It is
fast and lightweight, hence suitable for use in scripting and binding to
hotkeys. A command-line completion script for Bash is also included.
<<
DescUsage: <<
By default, mpc connects to port 6600 on localhost. This can be overridden
by setting MPD_HOST and MPD_PORT in the environment: e.g., one could append
the following to ~/.bash_profile
    export MPD_HOST=[password@]hostname MPD_PORT=1337
The password part of MPD_HOST is optional and may be omitted. Invoke:
    mpc help
to display a short usage summary; "man mpc" for more detailed information.
To be able to tab-complete mpc commands under Bash, append to your ~/.bashrc
the contents of %p/share/doc/mpc/mpc-bashrc .
