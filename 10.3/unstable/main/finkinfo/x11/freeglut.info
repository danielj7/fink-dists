Description: Opengl utility toolkit
DescDetail: <<
Freeglut is a completely OpenSourced alternative to the OpenGL Utility 
Toolkit (GLUT) library released under the X-Consortium license. The
original GLUT library seems to have been abandoned with the most recent
version (3.7) dating back to August 1998. Its license does not allow 
anyone to distribute modified library code. Freeglut is actively
developed and doesn't suffer the license restrictions. The goal is
to gradually depreciate the current glut package out of fink replacing
it with freeglut.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
This package is binary compatible with glut/glut-shlibs and can substitute
for them. Unfortunately I see no way to allow packages that currently
depend on a specific version of glut-shlibs to be upgraded without
changing those packages to have "Depends: glut-shlibs|freeglut-shlibs".
Note that I have used the LDFLAGS to prevent freeglut from linking its
demo programs against the installed libglut.
