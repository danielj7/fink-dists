DescDetail:<<
Maxima is a descendant of the symbol manipulation program Macsyma, which
had its roots in the late 1960s at MIT. Its abilities include basic
algebraic manipulation, symbolic integration, 2D and 3D plotting, and an
ODE solver. 
<<

DescUsage:<<
If you have trouble installing with Fink Commander, try installing from
the command line (and don't divert the output to a file).

Enter "maxima" to get a command line interface, and "xmaxima" to get a
graphical interface under xwindows.
<<

DescPort: <<
IMPORTANT: Maxima will only reliably work with the version (and
revision) of CLISP that was used to build it.  For that reason, this
pacakge has a versioned dependency on Fink's CLISP package.

Previous versions maintained by William McCallum and Matthias Neeracher.
