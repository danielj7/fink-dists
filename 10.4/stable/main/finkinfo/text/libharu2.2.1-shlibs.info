DescDetail: <<
libHaru is a free, cross platform, open source library for generating PDF 
files. At this moment libHaru does not support reading and editing existing 
PDF files and it's unlikely this support will ever appear.

It supports the following features:

    Generating PDF files with lines, text, images.
    Outline, text annotation, link annotation.
    Compressing document with deflate-decode.
    Embedding PNG, Jpeg images.
    Embedding Type1 font and TrueType font.
    Creating encrypted PDF files.
    Using various character sets (ISO8859-1~16, MSCP1250~8, KOI8-R).
    Supporting CJK fonts and encodings. 

You can add the feature of PDF creation by using HARU without 
understanding complicated internal structure of PDF.

libHaru is written in ANSI C, so theoretically it supports most of the 
modern OSes.

libpng15 patch from here:
### http://sources.gentoo.org/cgi-bin/viewvc.cgi/gentoo-x86/media-libs/libharu/files/libharu-2.2.1-libpng-1.5.patch?revision=1.1

Package is named libharu because that's what upstream calls itself.  However, 
the shared library is named libhpdf.dylib.
