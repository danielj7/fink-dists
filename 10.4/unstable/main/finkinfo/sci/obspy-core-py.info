Description: Python for seismological observatories
DescDetail: <<
This is obspy-core

ObsPy is an open-source project dedicated to provide a Python
framework for processing seismological data. It provides parsers for
common file formats and seismological signal processing routines which
allow the manipulation of seismological time series (see Beyreuther et
al. 2010, Megies et al. 2011).

The goal of the ObsPy project is to facilitate rapid application
development for seismology.
