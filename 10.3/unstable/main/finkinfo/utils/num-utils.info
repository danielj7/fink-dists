Description: Command-line utils for dealing with numbers
DescDetail: <<
The 'num-utils' are a set of programs for dealing with numbers from the
Unix command line. Much like the other Unix command line utilities like
grep, awk, sort, cut, etc. these utilities work on data from both
standard in and data from files. The utility set currently includes the
following programs:
*  average: A program for calculating the average of numbers.
*  bound: Finds the boundary numbers (min and max) of input.
*  interval: Shows the numeric intervals between each number in a sequence.
*  normalize-n: Normalizes a set of numbers between 0 and 1 by default.
*  numgrep: Like normal grep, but for sets of numbers.
*  numprocess: Do mathmatical operations on numbers.
*  numsum: Add up all the numbers.
*  random: Generate a random number from a given expression.
*  range: Generate a set of numbers in a range expression.
*  round: Round each number according to it's value.

 Renamed normalize to normalize-n so we don't conflict with normalize pkg.
