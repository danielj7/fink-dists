Description: Jakarta Commons - Logging
DescDetail: <<
There is a great need for debugging and logging information inside of
Commons components such as HTTPClient and DBCP.  However, there are
many logging APIs out there and it is difficult to choose among them.

The Logging package is an ultra-thin bridge between different logging
libraries.  Commons components may use the Logging API to remove
compile-time and run-time dependencies on any particular logging
package, and contributors may write Log implementations for the
library of their choice.
