Description: Program designed to draw chemical molecules
DescDetail: <<
EasyChem is a bit difficult to learn, but when you master it, you can be very 
fast, and with a huge precision.  In fact, it's just like a specialized
vectorial drawing tool.
The main features I am interested in are:
Drawing very easily ornaments (non-bonding electron pairs, ...)
EPS exporting with LaTeX fonts (Computer Modern)
