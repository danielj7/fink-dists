DescDetail: <<
FindBugs is a program to find bugs in Java programs.  It looks for
instances of "bug patterns" --- code instances that are likely to be
errors.

Changes since version 0.6.3:

  * Fixed bug in Ant task where output would be corrupted, and added a
    timeout attribute
  * Added -outputFile option to text UI, for explicitly specifying an
    output file
  * GUI has a summary window, for statistics about overall bug densities
    (contributed by Mike Fagan)
  * Find redundant comparisons of reference values
  * More accurate detection of Strings compared with == and != operators
  * Detection of other reference types which should generally not be
    compared with == and != operators; Boolean, Integer, etc.
  * Find non-transient non-serializable instance fields in Serializable
    classes
  * Source code may be compiled with latest early access generics-enabled
    javac (version 2.2)

Although findbugs itself is released under the LGPL, the findbugs and
mergeResults scripts contain code "shamelessly stolen from Ant's
'bin/ant' script" and are thus released under the Apache Software
License. That is why the license field is "OSI-Approved"
