Description: Light-weight implementation of Standard ML
DescDetail: <<
Moscow ML is a light-weight implementation of Standard ML (SML),
a strict functional language widely used in teaching and research.
Version 2.01 implements the full SML language, including SML
Modules, and much of the SML Basis Library. 
<<
DescPort: <<

Some include files conflict with the C++ standard library.

The package incorporates some patches implementing support for DESTDIR
in the installation scripts.  These were taken from the Moscow ML
homepage.
