DescDetail: <<
This is a multi-tabbed terminal emulation program based on aterm 
version 0.4.2. This terminal supports most of the features of aterm, 
including a small footprint, fast, and pseudo-transparency. It also has 
tabs, a la GMT (gnome-multi-terminal). Finally, it does not require 
gnome or KDE, just X11 libs. 
<<
DescUsage: <<
No docs or man pages are yet included with this program. I would 
recommend reading the aterm man page, as much of the code base is 
identical.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
Patch to relocate "putenv("TERM=" TERMENV);" and adjacent code before 
scr_init() is from Alexis, the author of multi-aterm. This properly sets 
TERM environment variable in the terminal.
