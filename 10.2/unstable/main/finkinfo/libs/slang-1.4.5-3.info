Description: Embedable extension language and console I/O lib
DescDetail: <<
S-Lang is an interpreted language that was designed from the start to
be easily embedded into a program to provide it with a powerful
extension language.

S-Lang also provides a platform-independent interface for screen
management, keymaps and low-level terminal I/O.

DescPort: <<
To use the terminfo database provided by the sltermin.c file is patched with the path.

Module loading should work thanks to dlcompat, but the shipped modules
are not built right now.

CPPFLAGS is ignored, so we use CFLAGS instead.
