Description: OAuth request-signing logic for python

DescDetail: <<
    OAuth often seems complicated and difficult-to-implement. There are several
    prominent libraries for handling OAuth requests, but they all suffer from
    one or both of the following:

    They predate the OAuth 1.0 spec, AKA RFC 5849.
    They predate the OAuth 2.0 spec, AKA RFC 6749.
    They assume the usage of a specific HTTP request library.
    OAuthLib is a generic utility which implements the logic of OAuth without
    assuming a specific HTTP request object or web framework. Use it to graft
    OAuth client support onto your favorite HTTP library, or provide support
    onto your favourite web framework. If you're a maintainer of such a
    library, write a thin veneer on top of OAuthLib and get OAuth support for 
    very little effort.
