Description: Norman Walsh's XSL DocBook stylesheets
DescDetail: <<
 XSL stylesheets for the DocBook DTD (they are also completely
 compatible with the DocBook DSSSL DTD and the Simplified DocBook DTD).
<<
DescUsage: <<
 Obviously you need the DocBook DTD.
 If you want to process SGML files, you need also openjade and 
 probably both lpd and Norman Walsh dsssl stylesheets.
 Then if you want to use xsltproc, you have all installed already.
 If you want to use Saxon, you need to install it, and optionally
 (but recommanded) Xerces, which provides additional features. 
 The documentation is installed in %p/share/doc/docbook-xsl.
 This release is mainly a bug fix release, though it has two
 new features: 
 1 - highlighting support in programlisting
 It requires xslthl, see 
 <http://xmlguru.cz/2006/07/docbook-syntax-highlightingbrings>
 for details.
 2 - Reworking of autoindexing
 kimber and kosek methods should be now implemented with
 customization layer.
 Default indexing method is now basic and handles accented
 characters.
 See the release notes for more info:

<<
DescPackaging: <<
 The stylesheets are installed in %p/share/xml/xsl/docbook-xsl/ to
 allow installation of other stylesheet packages in %p/share/xml/xsl/
<<
DescPort: <<
Previous maintainer Thomas Kotzian <thomas.kotzian@gmx.at>
Adding proper prefix to rm, cp, cat, and install so that there is no
problem with other versions of those tools installed elsewhere.
Added documentation
