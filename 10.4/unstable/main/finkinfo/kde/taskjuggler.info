# details
DescDetail: <<

TaskJuggler is a project management tool for Linux and UNIX-like
operating systems. Its new approach to project planning and tracking is
far superior to the commonly used Gantt chart editing tools. It has
already been successfully used in many projects and scales easily to
projects with hundreds of resources and thousands of tasks.

If you are about to build a skyscraper or just want to put together
your colleague's shift plan for the next month, TaskJuggler is the
right tool for you. If you just want to draw nice looking Gantt charts
to impress your boss or your investors, TaskJuggler might not be right
for you. It takes some effort to master its power, but it will become a
companion you don't want to miss anymore.

DescPackaging: <<
Build failure due to implicit symbol resolution from .la files 
(after package modified locally to avoid autotools complaint)
was reported by AKH on 28-04-2011.  

No reply from maintainer.

AKH fixed the package on 09-05-2011.
<<
DescPort: <<
Eplicitly choose automake1.10 and autoconf so that build works on all
platforms.

LDFLAGS for the KDE-using variant needs to include a bunch of libs explictly,
since the package apparently had been relying on .la files to figure out what
to link.
