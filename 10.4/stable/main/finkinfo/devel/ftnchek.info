Description: Fortran source code analyzer
DescDetail: <<
ftnchek is a static analyzer for Fortran 77 programs. It is designed 
to detect certain errors in a Fortran program that a compiler usually 
does not. ftnchek is not primarily intended to detect syntax errors. 
Its purpose is to assist the user in finding semantic errors. 
Semantic errors are legal in the Fortran language but are wasteful 
or may cause incorrect operation. For example, variables which are 
never used may indicate some omission in the program; uninitialized 
variables contain garbage which may cause incorrect results to be 
calculated; and variables which are not declared may not have the 
intended type. ftnchek is intended to assist users in the debugging 
of their Fortran program. It is not intended to catch all syntax errors. 
This is the function of the compiler. Prior to using ftnchek, the user 
should verify that the program compiles correctly.

DescUsage: <<
Usage: ftnchek [-option -option ...] filename [filename ...]
 "ftnchek --help" gives a brief list of commandline options
<<
DescPort: <<
 The Makefile contains some rm, which are unnecessary for fink and 
 prevent validation. Therefore, the programs, the man pages and 
 the documentation are installed explicitly.
 Installation of emacs modules is missing for now. Too much work.
