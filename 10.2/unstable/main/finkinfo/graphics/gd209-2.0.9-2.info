Description: Graphics generation library
DescDetail: <<
 The GD library is useful for creating graphics like hit counters on
 the fly. This version supports the PNG, JPEG and WBMP formats and lets
 you use TrueType fonts rendered via freetype2.

 gd209 is in fink temporarily until problems with gd-pm get sorted out.
<<
DescPort: <<
 The dynamic library needs the -fno-common switch.
 For some reason, libiconv is not found at link time, so we explicitly
  invoke it.
 When an older version is installed, the wrong library version may be
  linked against; the CCLD="gcc -L./.libs" is a workaround for this.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
 This package is based on previous work by Chris Pepper, Jeremy Higgs
 and Peter O'Gorman.  Previously maintained by Christoph Pfisterer.
