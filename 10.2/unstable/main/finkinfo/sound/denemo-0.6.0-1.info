Description: Graphical musical score editor
DescDetail: <<
Denemo is the GNU graphical musical score editor, and serves as a frontend to Lilypond. 
Though its behavior and features will no doubt continue to be refined, it is already perfectly usable.
<<
DescUsage: <<
	*** The provided keymapping is somewhat different from the one described
	in share/doc/denemo/README because of the way the keyboard is mapped in XDarwin.
	Note also that my keymapping was done on a french keyboard so everything may not work for you.
	You can refer to .denemo/keymaprc in your home directory for more details.
	Any new keymap files are welcome.	****
<<
DescPort: <<
Patch includes for gnugetopt/getopt.h, libxml/tree.h, libxml/parser.h and sys/wait.h
NLS disabled due to a bug with keymapping
Added a macosx keymapping provided as default
