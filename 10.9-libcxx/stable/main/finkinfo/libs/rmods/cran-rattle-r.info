DescDetail: <<
Rattle (the R Analytic Tool To Learn Easily) provides a Gnome
(RGtk2) based interface to R functionality for data mining.
The aim is to provide a simple and intuitive interface that
allows a user to quickly load data from a CSV file (or via ODBC),
transform and explore the data, build and evaluate models, and
export models as PMML (predictive modelling markup language) or
as scores. All of this with knowing little about R. All R
commands are logged and commented through the log tab. Thus
they are available to the user as a script file or as an aide
for the user to learn R or to copy-and-paste directly into R
itself. Rattle also exports a number of utility functions and
the graphical user interface, invoked as rattle(), does not
need to be run to deploy these.

DescPackaging: <<
