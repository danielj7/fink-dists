Description: Chess Information Database
DescDetail: <<
SCID (Shane's Chess Information Database) is a graphical chess data base 
application.
<<
DescPort:  <<
The configure mechanism and the Makefile included didn't seem
to have been very portable, so I bypassed the configure entirely.
<<
DescUsage: <<
chess-tex is really useful if you want to work with LaTeX, but did not
warrant pulling in teTeX.
