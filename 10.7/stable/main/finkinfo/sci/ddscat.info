Description: Discrete Dipole Approximation Code
DescDetail: <<
DDSCAT 7.2 is a freely available open-source Fortran-90 
software package applying the "discrete dipole approximation" 
(DDA) to calculate scattering and absorption of electromagnetic
waves by targets with arbitrary geometries and complex 
refractive index. The targets may be isolated entities (e.g.,
dust particles), but may also be 1-d or 2-d periodic arrays 
of "target unit cells", which can be used to study absorption, 
scattering, and electric fields around arrays of nanostructures.
<<
DescUsage: <<
An extensive user guide and the relevant literature in pdf form
are included in %p/share/doc/%n/doc/.

A collection of examples is included.
To run a test using all examples, copy the whole directory
%p/share/doc/%n/examples_exp and run the "runexamples" script,
for example as follows:
  rsync -a %p/share/doc/%n/examples_exp /tmp/
  cd /tmp/examples_exp
  ./runexamples

<<
DescPackaging: <<
 Configuring is done by modifying the Makefile or overriding
 Makefile variables. In this version, a double precision build
 is chosen, and gcc's openmp is linked to. OpenMP support is
 experimental, so if it gives erroneous results, it will be
 desactivated inf the future.
