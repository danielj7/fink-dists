Description: The Ogg Vorbis CODEC tools
DescDetail: <<
Ogg Vorbis is a fully Open, non-proprietary, patent-and-royalty-free, 
general-purpose compressed audio format for mid to high quality 
(8kHz-48.0kHz, 16+ bit, polyphonic) audio and music at fixed and 
variable bitrates from 16 to 128 kbps/channel. This places Vorbis 
in the same competetive class as audio representations such as 
MPEG-4 (AAC), and similar to, but higher performance than MPEG-1/2 
audio layer 3, MPEG-4 audio (TwinVQ), WMA and PAC.
.
Vorbis is the first of a planned family of Ogg multimedia coding 
formats being developed as part of Xiph.org's Ogg multimedia project. 
.
This package includes: ogg123, oggdec, oggenc, ogginfo, vcut, vorbiscomment

DescPort: <<
The patch is a hack to solve the problem with ogg123 hanging at exit.

The package was updated to install the man pages into the correct temporary
directory, instead of directly into /sw. It also now uses libcurl3 instead of
curl-dev.
