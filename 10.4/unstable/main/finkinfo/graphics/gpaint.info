DescDetail: <<
 This is gpaint (GNU Paint), a small-scale painting program for GNOME, the GNU
 Desktop.  Gpaint does not attempt to compete with GIMP.  Think of GIMP is like
 Photoshop as gpaint is like Windows Paint.

 Gpaint is still work in progress and many features are still being developed. 
 However, gpaint is useable already for simple image editing.
