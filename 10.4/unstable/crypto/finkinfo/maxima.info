# not sure about those bdeps; also: + recode-dev ? + tcltk-dev ?
# <AKH> It doesn't actually seem to _link_ tcltk, but uses its 
# wish shell at runtime.
# dep on rlwrap (>= 0.28-1) because of rmaxima
# among the deps, the following would suffice by recursivity: clisp gnuplot libsigsegv-shlibs recode rlwrap tcltk

DescPackaging: <<
Pkg in crypto because of preamble of COPYING _ even though
it states explicitly NOT to be part of the licence.

DescDetail: << 
Maxima is a symbolic computation program. It is full featured, including
symbolic manipulation of polynomials, matrices, rational functions,
integration, Todd-coxeter, 2D and 3D plotting, an ODE solver, and bigfloats.
It containss a symbolic source level debugger for maxima code.
Maxima is based on the original MACsyma developed at MIT in the 1970's.
<<
DescUsage: <<
Enter "rmaxima" for a command line interface, or "xmaxima" for a
graphical Tk-based interface (Aqua-based in the -nox variant).
<<
DescPort: <<
IMPORTANT: Maxima will only reliably work with the version (and
revision) of CLISP that was used to build it. For that reason,
this package has a versioned dependency on Fink's CLISP package,
that needs to be updated, and this package rev-bumped,
any time the clisp package's version or revision changes.

xmaxima -l sbcl still gives trouble (when adding '--enable-sbcl' to %c), even with latest sbcl.

Previous versions maintained by William McCallum, Matthias Neeracher, and Andrea Riciputi.
