Description: LaTeX Symbols Selector
DescDetail: <<
 LSS is a symbol browser to help creating LaTeX documents with many math
 symbols.
 All symbols are grouped into categories and user can copy symbol name to
 system-wide clipboard (or insert it directly to first running copy of gVIM) by
 selecting symbol icon from list. Many non-standard (and unsupported in LSS)
 symbols can be found in the comprehensive LATEX symbol list at
 http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/symbols/comprehensive.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
	Once again, many thanks to pogma (Peter O'Gorman).
	This package wouldn't exist without his kind assistance.
<<
DescUsage: <<
	If you want to use LSS with gVIM add following line to your ~/.vimrc file:
	
	autocmd BufWinEnter *.tex imap <F8> <Esc>:silent !lss &<cr>a
	
	Now, you can press <F8> key while editing *.tex file to call LSS and insert
	name of selected symbol in cursor position. This mapping use <F8> key in
	insert mode and you can use another shortcut key if you want - for more
	information check http://www.vim.org/htmldoc/map.html.
