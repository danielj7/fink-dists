Description: Scanner Access Now Easy
DescDetail: <<
	SANE stands for "Scanner Access Now Easy" and is an application programming
	interface (API) that provides standardized access to any raster image 
	scanner hardware (flatbed scanner, hand-held scanner, video- and still-cameras,
	frame-grabbers, etc.). The SANE API is public domain and its discussion and
	development is open to everybody.
