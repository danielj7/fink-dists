Description: Collection of DICOM libs and applications
DescDetail: <<
DCMTK is a collection of libraries and applications implementing large 
parts the DICOM standard for medical image communication. It includes 
software for examining, constructing and converting DICOM image files, 
handling offline media, sending and receiving images over a network 
connection, as well as demonstration image storage and worklist servers.
<<
DescUsage: <<
To use this toolkit, it is useful to have a basic knowledge of the 
DICOM standard for medical image communication. Starting points are
<http://medical.nema.org/dicom.html> which has an online version
of the standard and David Clunies website <http://www.dclunie.com>
which also hosts the alt.medical.image FAQ and other very good 
information.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
This package version includes a patch from OFFIS which fixes problems
with dcmcjpeg and dcmdjpeg.
<<
DescPort: <<
Natively supports Mac OSX.

Compiles without thread support because the IPC implementation on Mac OS X 
10.1 is incomplete. This is filed as bug #2676742 in Apples Bug Reporting 
System <http://www.opensource.apple.com/bugs/X/Kernel/2676742.html>
and there seems to be an implementation at <http://www-cse.ucsd.edu/~bellardo/xnu/sysvsem.html> (which I haven't tried...)
