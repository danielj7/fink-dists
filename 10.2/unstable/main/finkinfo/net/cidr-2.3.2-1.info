Description: Calculates CIDR network and broadcast addresses
DescDetail: <<
cidr is a program to calculate CIDR network and broadcast addresses for a
given IP and mask.  I wrote this primarily to aid myself in reconfiguring my
home LAN, where I often change IP addresses and subnet ranges, because I find
it difficult to remember the appropriate network and broadcast address for a
given /N subnet.  The proper addresses are found in the subnet tables in RFC
1878. 

The program takes an IP and netmask and outputs the network address,
broadcast address, and total number of addresses for the corresponding
subnet.  The IP address can be in binary, decimal, hexadecimal, or
dotted-quad form, and the mask can be in binary, decimal, hex, dotted-quad,
or prefix.  I decided to have the program accept those forms of input
primarily as a learning tool, since I thought it would be interesting to
see how bitwise changes in an IP address affect the dotted-quad form of
that address.
