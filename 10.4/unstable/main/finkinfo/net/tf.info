Description: TinyFugue, a popular MUSH and MUD client
DescDetail: <<
TinyFugue, aka "tf", is a flexible, screen-oriented MUD client, for
use with any type of MUD. TinyFugue is one of the most popular and
powerful mud clients.
<<
DescPackaging: This program does not use a standard configure / make system and required a little bit of patching to the build scripts in order to work well with fink.  This is my first attempt at making a fink package.
