Description: Library to provide various hashing algorithms
DescDetail: <<
Mhash is a free (under GNU Lesser GPL) library which provides a uniform interface to a 
large number of hash algorithms. These algorithms can be used to compute checksums, message
digests, and other signatures. The HMAC support implements the basics for message 
authentication, following RFC 2104. In the later versions some key generation algorithms, 
which use hash algorithms, have been added. The manpage for libmhash is mhash.3. 
To view the man page please type man mhash at the prompt.
At the time of writing this, the library supports the algorithms:
SHA1, GOST, HAVAL256, HAVAL224, HAVAL192, HAVAL160, HAVAL128, MD5, MD4, RIPEMD160, TIGER, 
TIGER160, TIGER128, CRC32B and CRC32 checksums. 
<<
DescPackaging: <<
Main reason to provide this library is, that it is needed for mcrypt version 2.6 and higher.
