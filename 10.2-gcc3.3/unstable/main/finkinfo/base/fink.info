Description: The Fink package manager
DescPackaging: <<
 Don't use mirror:sourceforge so that older package manager versions
 which do not know that mirror can still selfupdate.

 Must put "make test" before "./setup.sh %p", because make test runs
 the setup script itself, but pointed at the testing directory.
 The second run of setup.sh properly points fink at the installed
 configuration file.
<<
DescDetail: <<
fink is the Fink project's package manager. It is responsible for
downloading and compiling source and building binary packages from
it. Binary package handling is then delegated to dpkg.
