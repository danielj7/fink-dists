Description: Misc. tools for giFT
DescDetail: <<
giFT is a `recursive' acronym for `giFT: Internet File Transfer'. The
giFT project is actually a collection of several components together:
the giFT daemon (which acts as bridge to the actual file sharing
protocols), OpenFT (a p2p network designed to exploit all the
functionality giFT supports), and a user interface front-end.

Note that giFT is alpha software (but it works!), and is still very much
under development!  You should update *often*.
