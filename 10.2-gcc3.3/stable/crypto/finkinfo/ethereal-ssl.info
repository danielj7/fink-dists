Description: Powerful network protocol analyzer (with SSL)
DescDetail: <<
Ethereal is a free network protocol analyzer for Unix and Windows.
It allows you to examine data from a live network or from a capture
file on disk. You can interactively browse the capture data, viewing
summary and detail information for each packet. Ethereal has several
powerful features, including a rich display filter language and the
ability to view the reconstructed stream of a TCP session.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
 Although this package has a GPL license, it is marked Restrictive since
 it links to openssl.

To prevent source URL problems once they update to a new version again,
this package uses CustomMirror.
<<
DescPort: <<
Fix to configure so that ethereal correctly detects dlopen is available.
DESTDIR required for docsis plugin & manpages to install properly.
