# Documentation.
DescDetail: <<
PyChecker is a tool for finding bugs in python source code.  It finds
problems that are typically caught by a compiler for less dynamic
languages, like C and C++.  It is similar to lint.  Because of the
dynamic nature of python, some warnings may be incorrect; however,
spurious warnings should be fairly infrequent.

PyChecker works in a combination of ways.  First, it imports each
module.  If there is an import error, the module cannot be processed.
The import provides some basic information about the module.  The code
for each function, class, and method is checked for possible problems.
