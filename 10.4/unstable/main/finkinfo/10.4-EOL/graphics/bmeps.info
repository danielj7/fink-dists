Description: Convert PNG/JPEG/NetPBM to EPS
DescDetail: <<
bmeps converts bitmap images (PNG/JPEG/NetPBM) to EPS. The package consists
of a command line program and a library. EPS level 1, 2 or 3 can be created
using run-length compression, flate compression and ASCII-85-encoding
(depending on the EPS level).

This package does not contain the Java-based GUI that was added in version
1.2.6.
