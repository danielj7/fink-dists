# DISCLAIMER: Max Horn is the sole maintainer of this package.
# Please DO NOT MAKE MODIFICATIONS without informing the maintainer.
# Preferably, send a patch to me instead of making changes yourself!
# If that is not possible due to extra urgency, at least send me a mail.
#
# Explanation: I am sick and tired of getting back to my packages and
# discovering that people have messed with it. I am then forced to
# retrace their steps, find out who, when and why did make a certain
# change etc. -- i.e. it makes my life as maintainer harder.
# Furthermore, as maintainer I am responsible for problems caused by my
# packages. But I am not willing to take responsibility for something I
# did not do. In particular, for changes that other people introduced
# behind my back, no matter how good and noble their intentions were. As
# such, I may see myself forced to drop responsibility for (and hence,
# maintainership of) the affected package.

Description: Finite Field Linear Algebra Subroutines
DescDetail: <<
FFLAS-FFPACK is a LGPL source code library for dense linear
algebra over word-size finite fields.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
* FFLAS-FFPACK relies on a BLAS library. This package is hard-coded to
  use Apple's Accelerate Framework. If you need to use it with another
  BLAS, e.g. Atlas, GSL, Lapack..., it should be possible to make a
  variant of this package supporting that. Please contact the maintainer
  if you are interested in this.

* we disable givaro support for now. Future versions of FFLAS-FFPACK use
  it, but only for the test suite. Once that happens, we will have to make
  sure that fflas-ffpack-config.h is cleaned up before installation,
  otherwise it could differ depending on whether tests where run or not.

* comment out unused OMPTimer class (required OpenMP), to allow tests to run
