+What is NCL?
+
+The NCAR Command Language (NCL) is a programming language designed
+specifically for the access, analysis, and visualization of data.
+NCL can be run in interactive mode, where each line is interpreted as
+it is entered at your workstation, or it can be run in batch mode as
+an interpreter of complete scripts.
+
+The power and utility of the language are evident in three areas:
+
+
+- file input and output
+- data processing
+- graphical display 
+
+NCL has many features common to modern programming languages,
+including types, variables, operators, expressions, conditional
+statements, loops, and functions and procedures.
+
+In addition to common programming features, NCL also has features that
+are not found in other programming languages, including features that
+handle the manipulation of metadata, the configuration of the output
+graphics, the import of data from a variety of data formats, and an
+algebra that supports array operations.
+
+NCL comes with many useful built-in functions and procedures for
+processing and manipulating data. There are over 400 functions and
+procedures that include routines for:
+
+
+- use specifically with climate and model data 
+- computing empirical orthogonal functions, Fourier
+    coefficients, singular value decomposition, averages, standard
+    deviations, sin, cosine, log, min, max, etc.
+- retrieving and converting date information 
+- drawing primitives (lines, filled areas, and markers), wind
+    barbs, weather map symbols, isosurfaces, and graphical objects
+- file handling 
+- 1-dimensional, 2-dimensional, and 3-dimensional interpolation,
+approximation, and regridding
+- facilitating computer analysis of scalar and vector global
+    geophysical quantities (most are based on the package known as
+    Spherepack)
+- retrieving environment variables and executing system commands
+
+
+NCL supports calling C and Fortran external routines, which makes NCL
+infinitely configurable.
+
+NCL uses several other publicly-available software packages for some
+of its file I/O and data processing routines.  These software packages
+include:
+
+
+
+ http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/HDF - a physical file
+format for storing scientific data
+
+ http://hdfeos.gsfc.nasa.gov/hdfeos/index.cfm"HDF-EOS
+- a library that is an extension of HDF, built specifically to handle
+data from the Earth Observing System (EOS), a suite of satellites
+launched by NASA.
+
+
+http://www.netlib.org/lapack/lug/lapack_lug.html"LAPACK - a
+library of Fortran 77 subroutines for solving the most commonly
+occurring problems in numerical linear algebra
+
+ http://ngwww.ucar.edu/ngdoc/ng4.3/ngmath/Ngmath -
+a collection of mathematical procedures for which there are
+equivalent Fortran, C, and NCL entries
+
+ http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/netcdf/netCDF
+- a machine-independent format for representing scientific data (also,
+an interface for array-oriented data access and a library that
+provides an implementation of the interface)
+
+
+http://www.scd.ucar.edu/css/software/spherepack/Spherepack
+- a collection of Fortran programs that facilitates computer modeling
+of geophysical processes
+
+
+http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/udunits/UDUNITS - a
+C/Fortran library that supports conversion of unit specifications
+between formatted and binary forms, arithmetic manipulation of unit
+specifications, and conversion of values between compatible scales of
+measurement.  NCL uses it in particular for converting UTC-referenced
+time.
