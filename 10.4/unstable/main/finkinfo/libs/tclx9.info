Description: Extended command set for Tcl
DescDetail: <<
The last official release of TclX is version 8.3.5 in October, 2002.
This is a build based off of a snapshot of the CVS tree.

The following text comes from  http://wiki.tcl.tk/207  


TclX (http://tclx.sf.net/) is an essential package of extensions for
Tcl. This package creates interpreters known as tcl. It adds advanced
code loading facility, new programming constructs, debugging and
profiling facilities, unix access commands, file I/O facilities
including awk-like scanning for strings, extended list and a new key
list capability, extended character and string manipulation commands,
and time and date manipulation commands.

Extended Tcl is oriented towards system programming tasks and large
application development. It provides a variety of additional
interfaces to the underlying operating system, as well as many new
programming constructs, text manipulation tools, and debugging
capabilities.

Over the years, a variety of features originally appeared in TclX, and
then, as the ideas were proven, migrated to the Tcl core. These
features include Tcl's I/O system, its associative arrays, Internet
networking interfaces, upvar, memory debugging... even incr.

TclX includes documentation on debugging memory problems on how to use
its keyed list data type, manipulating binary structures via handles,
a guide to writing Tcl commands in C , and a reference manual for the
new TclX commands themselves.

DescPort: <<
This info file is modeled after tix.info

This package is not setup to provide a static library, so none is
installed.

Since there is no recent tar ball, the authors said I should get it
from CVS, so here is the cvs commands I used to make a snapshot tar
ball.

cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/tclx login 
press enter for password
cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/tclx co tclx

It uses some internal headers of tcl in the generic directory, so it
pulls down the tcl src.

Don't know why libtool makes libtclx.8.0.4, so it gets renamed to 8.4.0.
