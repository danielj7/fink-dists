DescDetail: <<
Ghostess, a rough start at a graphical DSSI host, based on
jack-dssi-host, but capable of saving and restoring plugin
configuration, as well as specifying MIDI channels and layering
synths. ghostess includes three MIDI drivers: an ALSA sequencer MIDI
driver, a (clumsy but functional) CoreMIDI driver (which allows
ghostess to be used on Mac OS X), and a JACK MIDI driver for use with
the MIDI transport in recent versions (>=0.102.27) of JACK. ghostess
also comes with a universal DSSI GUI, which attempts to provide GUI
services for any DSSI or LADSPA plugin, and may be used with any DSSI
host.
