DescDetail: Blackbox is yet another addition to the list of window 
  managers for the Open Group's X Window System, Version 11 Release 6 
  and above. Blackbox is built with C++, sharing no common code with 
  any other window manager (even though the graphics implementation 
  is similar to that of Window Maker).
