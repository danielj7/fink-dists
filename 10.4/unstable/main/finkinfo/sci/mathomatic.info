Revision: 1
Description: Symbolic algebra program
DescDetail: <<
Mathomatic is a small, portable symbolic math program that can
automatically solve, simplify, differentiate, combine, and compare
algebraic equations, perform polynomial and complex arithmetic, etc.
<<
DescPort: <<
Compile with readline support for generic Unix.

This thing is very noisy under -Wall: lots of implicit forward
function declarations and forgetting to declare void function return
types. Ain't gonna fix it.

DescPackaging: <<
	m4 wrapper not installed (will need to hack to distinguish
	runtime from installation locations).

	fink on 64-bit automatically does 64-bit correctly (I think)
	so don't need to specially enable -m64 in makefile
