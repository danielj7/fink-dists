DescDetail: <<
 SoundTracker is a pattern-oriented music editor (similar to the DOS
 program 'FastTracker'). Samples are lined up on tracks and patterns
 which are then arranged to a song. Supported module formats are XM and
 MOD; the player code is the one from OpenCP. A basic sample recorder
 and editor is also included.
 
 See the README file for explanation on usage.
