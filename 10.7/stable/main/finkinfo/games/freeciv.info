DescDetail: <<
Freeciv is a Free and Open Source empire-building strategy game 
     inspired by the history of human civilization. The game 
     commences in prehistory and your mission is to lead your tribe 
     from the stone age to the space age...
<<
DescUsage: <<
To start freeciv:
   - At any command prompt type 'freeciv-gtk2' to start the GTK client.
   - The game window will come up giving you the option to join a
     server 'Connect to Network Game'. For a local game, select 
     'Start New Game', 'Start Scenario Game', or 'Load Saved Game' 
     as desired.  The server will start automagically if needed.
   - In-game sound effects are turned off by default.  To enable them, go to 
	 the client menu "Game" -> "Options" -> "Local Client".  Then select the
	 'Sound' tab to change the "Sound plugin" to 'sdl' and/or enable "Sound
	 bell at new turn".  To make these changes permanent, select "Save".
   - 'freeciv-server' can be used to manually start the server if so desired.
     Most folks won't need to do this.
   - The auxiliary program 'freeciv-manual' creates html versions of the
     rules.  It will fail if it doesn't have permission to write 
     the files, so either invoke from a directory that is writeable 
     by all, or invoke as a superuser.
   - The auxiliary program 'freeciv-modpack' will connect to the project 
     servers and display bonus content available for download such as tilesets
     [graphics], sounds, rulesets, and scenarios.  I personally recommend 
     'Freesounds'.
