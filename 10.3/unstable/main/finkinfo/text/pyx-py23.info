Description: <<
 PyX is a Python package to create EPS figures
<<
DescDetail: <<
 PyX is a Python package to create encapsulated PostScript figures. It provides
 classes and methods to access basic PostScript functionality at an abstract
 level. At the same time the emerging structures are very convenient to produce
 all kinds of drawings in a non-interactive way. In combination with the python
 language itself the user can just code any complexity of the figure wanted.
 Additionally an TeX/LaTeX interface enables one to use the famous high quality
 typesetting within the figures.

 A major part of PyX on top of the already described basis is the provision of
 high level functionality for complex tasks like 2d plots in publication-ready
 quality.
