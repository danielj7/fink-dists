DescDetail: <<
Net::Ping::External is a module which interfaces with the "ping" command on 
many systems. It presently provides a single function, ping(), that takes in a 
hostname and (optionally) a timeout and returns true if the host is alive, and 
false otherwise. Unless you have the ability (and willingness) to run your 
scripts as the superuser on your system, this module will probably provide 
more accurate results than Net::Ping will.
