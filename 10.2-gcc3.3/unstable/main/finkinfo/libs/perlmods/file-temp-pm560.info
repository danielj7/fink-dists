# Additional Data:
DescDetail: <<
This is release V0.12 of File::Temp. This module can be used to
generate temporary files (providing a filename and filehandle) or directories.
Possible race conditions are avoided and some security checks are performed
(eg making sure the sticky bit is set on world writeable temp directories).

It could be considered to be in a beta state since it has only been
tested on six operating systems.

Please let me know if it fails on other operating systems.
