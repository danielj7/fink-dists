DescDetail: <<
Blackbox is yet another addition to the list of window 
managers for the Open Group's X Window System, Version 11 Release 6 
and above. Blackbox is built with C++, sharing no common code with 
any other window manager (even though the graphics implementation 
is similar to that of Window Maker).

This version of blackbox includes a patch which turns the (otherwise
fairly useless) status bar at the bottom of the screen into a list of
currently iconified windows. This is particularly useful when running
X in rootless mode since the Workspaces menu is difficult to open 
without a root window to click upon.
