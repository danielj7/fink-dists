	DescUsage: <<
---[ Installation ]---------------------------------------------------

To install all of the official KDE packages, install "bundle-kde" or
"bundle-kde-ssl" (depending on whether crypotgraphic laws permit
downloading strong cryptography).  Unless you have a specific reason
not to, "bundle-kde-ssl" is suggested.

---[ Configuration ]--------------------------------------------------

To use KDE as your windowing system in XDarwin, create a file called
".xinitrc" in your home directory, containing the following line:

  /sw/bin/startkde >/tmp/kde.log 2>&1

See http://fink.sourceforge.net/doc/x11/run-xfree86.php#xinitrc
for more information on the xinitrc files and how they work.

If you want to use Apple's X11 instead of the KDE window manager,
put the following line before the startkde line in .xinitrc:

  export KDEWM=quartz-wm

Note that depending on your version of Apple's X11, this can cause
strange resizing issues with the kicker (KDE task bar).

---[ Startup ]--------------------------------------------------------

Once you have created an ~/.xinitrc file, you should be able to start
KDE by clicking on the "XDarwin" icon in your Applications folder.  

NOTE: By default, X11 on Mac OS X runs in "rootless" mode, generally.
If you run KDE in rootless mode, it will take over your desktop with
a window that covers everything up.  You can remove this by disabling
desktop icons in the KDE control center.  Open the control center
(either from the "K" menu bar, or by typing "kcontrol" in an xterm)
then expand the "Desktop" list, click "Behavior", and uncheck the
"Show icons on desktop" checkbox.
   
---[ Removal ]--------------------------------------------------------
   
To remove all of the official KDE packages, you can remove the KDE
libraries and anything that depends on them by running, in a terminal:
   
  sudo apt-get remove kdelibs3-universal-shlibs

To remove an individual KDE package collection (like kdenetwork3 or
kdesdk3) you can generally remove [package]-base.  For example, to
remove all of the kdenetwork3 packages, run:

  sudo apt-get remove kdenetwork3-base

	DescDetail: <<
KWord is a frame-based word-processing and desktop
publishing application.  KWord is capable of creating
demanding and professional looking documents.  Whether you
are a corporate or home user, production artist or student,
KWord will prove a valuable and easy to use tool for all
your word processing and layout needs.

KWord is a wordprocessor based on frames. This can be used
to place components in precise locations, as with many
professional DTP applications.  KWord can also handle huge
amounts of texts and allows you to do professional markup
with ease.

KWord's features include:

* paragraph style sheets (borders, alignment, spacing,
	indentation, bullet points, tab stops, page breaks, and
	font type, style, color and size), together with a stylist
	to edit, add, remove and update styles (a number of
	predefined styles are provided);
* a frame orientation, suitable for simple desktop
	publishing (DTP);
* numerous preset as well as custom page sizes;
* multiple columns per page;
* headers and footers (including different first page
	headers/footers);
* variables, such as page number, company name, user name,
	document summary, date and time or a custom variable;
* tables;
* embedding of text frames, images and clip-art (.wmf and
	.svg files);
* chapter numbering;
* auto-generation of table of contents;
* auto-correction and spell checking
* templates

NOTE: By default, X11 on Mac OS X runs in "rootless" mode, generally.
If you run KDE in rootless mode, it will take over your desktop with
a window that covers everything up.  You can remove this by disabling
desktop icons in the KDE control center.  Open the control center

	DescDetail: <<
KChart is the KOffice chart drawing application.  Use it to
embed charts into your KOffice documents, e.g. a report
written with KWord.

Easy to Use:

* default values for all parameters
* automatic ordinate axis computation based on
	highest/lowest data value
* default sizes (fonts, line widths...) relative to the
	window size

Highly Configurable:

* All of the parameters may be changed after
	configuring/drawing the chart.
* Size values (axis/grid line width, font sizes, bar width,
	dataset gap, pie chart radius ... ) may be specified in
	either absolute pixels or relative to the window size.
	This makes your chart layout-independent since such values
	are being recalculated automatically when the window
	dimensions have changed.

Flexible Layout:

* Legends may be centered at a chart edge or in a corner
	with the chart making way in vertical and/or in horizontal
	direction thus offering 16 legend/chart relationships to
	choose from
* Header and footer texts have special font type/size and
	color settings

Axes and Data:

* Automatical ordinate axis computation based on
	highest/lowest data value which can be easily replaced by
	programmer-defined start, end and delta value settings.
* Abscissa labels may be taken either from data cells
	containing the respective strings or from
	programmer-defined QStringLists or calculated
	automatically based on a format chosen by the user and
	values found in the cells
* Up to 8 axes: 2 left, 2 right, 2 top, 2 bottom
* A chart may have 2 different ordinates: e.g. left axis for
	series 1,2,3 right axis for data series 4
* Each axis may draw (sub-)grid lines using their own color,
	line width, style

Chart Combinations:

* sharing the same abscissa axis or using different ones
	(e.g Top and Bottom axis)
* sharing the same ordinate or using different ones (e.g
	Left and Right axis)
* Axes may use the same line color / line width as the bars
	(or the lines, resp.) which they belong to.

Chart Types:

* Bar: normal | stacked | percent, 2D | 3D-Look
* Line: normal | stacked | percent, 2D | 3D-Look, show
	marker: circle | square | diamond
* Area: normal | stacked | percent
* HiLo: normal | open-close
* Pie: normal | exploded | some exploded, 2D | 3D
* Ring: normal | exploded | some exploded, fixed
	thickness | relative thickness
* Polar: normal | stacked | percent

To install all of the official KDE packages, install "bundle-kde" or
"bundle-kde-ssl" (depending on whether crypotgraphic laws permit
downloading strong cryptography).  Unless you have a specific reason
not to, "bundle-kde-ssl" is suggested.

---[ Configuration ]--------------------------------------------------

To use KDE as your windowing system in XDarwin, create a file called
".xinitrc" in your home directory, containing the following line:

See http://fink.sourceforge.net/doc/x11/run-xfree86.php#xinitrc
for more information on the xinitrc files and how they work.

If you want to use Apple's X11 instead of the KDE window manager,
put the following line before the startkde line in .xinitrc:

  export KDEWM=quartz-wm

Note that depending on your version of Apple's X11, this can cause
strange resizing issues with the kicker (KDE task bar).

	DescDetail: <<
Kexi is an integrated data management application.  It can
be used for creating database schemas, inserting data,
performing queries, and processing data.  Forms can be
created to provide a custom interface to your data.  All
database objects - tables, queries and forms - are stored in
the database, making it easy to share data and design.

As a real member of the KDE and KOffice projects, Kexi
integrates fluently into both.

Kexi is considered as a long awaited Open Source competitor
for MS Access, Filemaker and Oracle Forms.  Its development
is motivated by the lack of Rapid Application Development
(RAD) tools for database systems that are sufficiently
powerful, inexpensive, open standards driven and portable
across many operating systems and hardware platforms.

a window that covers everything up.  You can remove this by disabling
desktop icons in the KDE control center.  Open the control center
(either from the "K" menu bar, or by typing "kcontrol" in an xterm)
then expand the "Desktop" list, click "Behavior", and uncheck the
"Show icons on desktop" checkbox.
   
---[ Removal ]--------------------------------------------------------
   
To remove all of the official KDE packages, you can remove the KDE
libraries and anything that depends on them by running, in a terminal:
   
  sudo apt-get remove kdelibs3-universal-shlibs

To remove an individual KDE package collection (like kdenetwork3 or
kdesdk3) you can generally remove [package]-base.  For example, to
remove all of the kdenetwork3 packages, run:

  sudo apt-get remove kdenetwork3-base

	DescDetail: <<
Kugar is a KDE tool for generating business quality reports
which can be viewed and printed.  It includes a standalone
report viewer and a KPart report viewer.  The latter means
that any KDE application can embed the report viewing
functionality and that reports can be viewed using the
Konqueror browser.

Kugar works by merging application generated data with a
template to produce the final report.  Both the data and the
template are specified using XML.  This approach means that
applications only need worry about generating the data
itself.  A template can be referenced via a URL which allows
businesses to create a centrally managed template library.

Features include:

* Kugar report designer.
* Report printing in Postscript.
* Database/datasource neutral, data is supplied to the
	report engine in XML.
* Support for direct database access.
* Open report definition files, report layout is stored in
	XML.
* Full control of fonts, colors, text alignment and
	wrapping.
* Report Header/Footer.
* Page Header/Footer.
* Detail Section.
* Detail Header/Footer.
* Unlimited number of detail levels.
* Grand totals: count, sum, average, variance and standard
	deviation.
* Additional formatting (negative numbers, currency, commas
	for numbers and dates).

	DescUsage: <<
---[ Installation ]---------------------------------------------------

To install all of the official KDE packages, install "bundle-kde" or
"bundle-kde-ssl" (depending on whether crypotgraphic laws permit
downloading strong cryptography).  Unless you have a specific reason
not to, "bundle-kde-ssl" is suggested.

---[ Configuration ]--------------------------------------------------

To use KDE as your windowing system in XDarwin, create a file called
".xinitrc" in your home directory, containing the following line:

  /sw/bin/startkde >/tmp/kde.log 2>&1

See http://fink.sourceforge.net/doc/x11/run-xfree86.php#xinitrc
for more information on the xinitrc files and how they work.

If you want to use Apple's X11 instead of the KDE window manager,
put the following line before the startkde line in .xinitrc:

  export KDEWM=quartz-wm

Note that depending on your version of Apple's X11, this can cause
strange resizing issues with the kicker (KDE task bar).

---[ Startup ]--------------------------------------------------------

Once you have created an ~/.xinitrc file, you should be able to start
KDE by clicking on the "XDarwin" icon in your Applications folder.  

NOTE: By default, X11 on Mac OS X runs in "rootless" mode, generally.
If you run KDE in rootless mode, it will take over your desktop with
a window that covers everything up.  You can remove this by disabling
