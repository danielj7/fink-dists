DescDetail: <<
The Jabber WindowGram Client (JWGC) is a Jabber client that does not behave
like a standard chat client.  Instead, it is intended to look and feel almost
exactly like MIT's Zephyr system.  Whereas most chat clients focus on a single
window to house a conversation between another person and yourself, JWGC pops
up a separate window for every message you receive.  To respond, you run a
command-line application, type in your message, and send it on it's way.  If
you are familiar with the Zephyr system, JWGC should be trivial to adapt to.
<<
DescUsage: <<
Start off by running jwgc -u <username>.  It will prompt you for a password
and then background itself.  After that, you can run jlocate, jctl, jwrite,
and jstat to interact with jwgc.  You will probably want to read over the
manual pages for all of the components to get a better feel for what you
can do with it.
