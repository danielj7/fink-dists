Description: Science fiction adventure game
DescDetail: <<
	A science-fiction thriller set in a bleak post-apocalyptic vision of the
	future, Beneath a Steel Sky revolves around "Union City", where
	selfishness, rivalry, and corruption by its citizens seems to be all too
	common, those who can afford it live underground, away from the
	pollution and social problems which are plaguing the city. 
	 You take on the role of Robert Foster, an outcast of sorts from the city
	since a boy who was raised in a remote environment outside of Union City
	simply termed "the gap". Robert's mother took him away from Union City as
	a child on their way to "Hobart" but the helicopter crashed on its way,
	unfortunately Robert's mother dies, but he survives and is left to be raised
	by a local tribe from the gap. 
	 Years later, Union City security drops by and abducts Robert, killing his
	tribe in the process; upon reaching the city the helicopter taking him there
	crashes with him escaping, high upon a tower block in the middle of the
	city he sets out to discover the truth about his past, and to seek vengeance
	for the killing of his tribe. 
	 Note that this package only contains game-data. The game engine is
	provided by ScummVM.
