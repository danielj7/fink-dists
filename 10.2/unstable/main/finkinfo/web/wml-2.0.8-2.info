Description: Website META Language, offline HTML generation toolkit
DescDetail: <<
WML consists of a control frontend driving up to nine backends in a
sequential pass-oriented filtering scheme. Each backend provides one
particular core language. While not trivial and idiot proof WML provides
most of the core features real hackers always wanted for HTML generation.
