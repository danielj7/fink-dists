Description: Network exploration utility
DescDetail: <<
	nmap, a utility for network exploration or auditing, supporting ping scanning,
	port scanning and TCP/IP fingerprinting. It also offers decoy scanning, sunRPC
	scanning, reverse-identd scanning and others.
	
	This package also contains:
		nping: Network packet generation tool / ping utility
		ncat:  Concatenate and redirect sockets
		ndiff: Utility to compare the results of Nmap scans
	
	Version 3.46 thanks to Alex Barclay <prozac@utulsa.edu>.
	
	The GUI is now included in the 'zenmap' package.
	
	6.00 introduces the 'nmap-update' command which allows one to download
	the latest scripts and OS-fingerprints from an official svn repo.
	This repo isn't generally available yet so don't bother trying to
	use it until it is.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
	Use Fink-installed libpcre instead of building our own.
	Now scriptable with lua!
	
	Switch to included libdnet and libpcap as they're newer and have
	nmap-specific patches.
