DescDetail: <<
You are captain of the cargo ship Chromium B.S.U., responsible for delivering 
supplies to our troops on the front line. Your ship has a small fleet of 
robotic fighters which you control from the relative safety of the Chromium 
vessel. 

* Do not let ANY enemy ships get past your fighters! Each enemy ship that 
makes it past the bottom of the screen will attack the Chromium, and you lose 
a fighter.
* Use your fighters as weapons! Crash into enemies to destroy them before 
they can get past you. 
* Strategic suicide is a powerful tactic! When the Chromium launches a new 
fighter, it releases a high energy burst which destroys all enemies in range.
* Self-destruct to preserve your ammunition! A double-right-click will cause 
your current fighter to self-destruct. Before the ship blows up, it ejects its 
ammunition so that the next fighter can pick it up.
