# DISCLAIMER: Max Horn is the sole maintainer of this package.
# Please DO NOT MAKE MODIFICATIONS without informing the maintainer.
# Preferably, send a patch to me instead of making changes yourself!
# If that is not possible due to extra urgency, at least send me a mail.
#
# Explanation: I am sick and tired of getting back to my packages and
# discovering that people have messed with it. I am then forced to
# retrace their steps, find out who, when and why did make a certain
# change etc. -- i.e. it makes my life as maintainer harder.
# Furthermore, as maintainer I am responsible for problems caused by my
# packages. But I am not willing to take responsibility for something I
# did not do. In particular, for changes that other people introduced
# behind my back, no matter how good and noble their intentions were. As
# such, I may see myself forced to drop responsibility for (and hence,
# maintainership of) the affected package.

Description: C++ library for eXtended Scientific Computing
DescDetail: <<
C-XSC is a tool for the development of numerical algorithms
delivering highly accurate and automatically verified results.
It provides a large number of predefined numerical data types
and operators. These types are implemented as C++ classes.
Thus, C-XSC allows high-level programming of numerical
applications in C and C++.

# Note: For now we are using the cmake build system. We could
# also try building with the autoconf/automake build system.
# Both are marked "experimental". Neither seems to be setup to
# build shared libraries. Oh well.

# TODO: tweak it to build a shared library
