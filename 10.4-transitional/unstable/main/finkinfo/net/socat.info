Description: Relay for data transfer between two sockets
DescPackaging: <<
 * Didn't splitoff the .a libraries, but they aren't installed by
   default anyway.  Email me if you need them and I'll try.
 * To run the tests, do the following:
   - Use the fink --keep-build-dir option when building
   - After build, cd /sw/src/%f/socat-1.4
   - Tweak the test.sh script by uncommenting the MISCDELAY=1 line
     perhaps via "sudo perl -i -pe's/\#(MISCDELAY=1)/$1/' test.sh"
   - run "sudo ./test.sh"
 * See also socat-ssl.info in the crypto branch
