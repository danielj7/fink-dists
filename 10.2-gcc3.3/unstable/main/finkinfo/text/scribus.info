Description: Layout program
DescDetail: <<
Scribus is a Layout program in the tradition of Corel Ventura[tm], Adobe
PageMaker[tm], QuarkXPress[tm] or Adobe InDesign[tm], except that it is
published under the GNU GPL.

Since its launch in the spring of 2001, Scribus 1.+ offers Linux and Unix
users a versatile and user friendly page layout application. Scribus 1.0 and
its recent development versions are being used in a number of ways; from
brochure design to newsletters and posters to technical
documentation. Scribus has the type of the features one would expect in a
sophisticated page layout application. You can do all the typical tasks like
precision placing and rotating of text and/or images on a page, specify
manual kerning of type and much more. With the release of Scribus 1.0, Linux
and Unix users now have one more high quality application for the desktop,
making it the premier choice for DTP on Linux or BSD with other platforms to
come.

Underneath the modern and user friendly interface, Scribus supports
professional publishing features, such as CMYK color and a simple color
management system to soft proof images destined for high quality color
printing, Other features include flexible PDF creation options, PDF Import,
Encapsulated Postscript import/export and creation of 4 color
separations. Scribus also supports via freetype Unicode text including right
to left scripts such as Arabic and Hebrew.

Graphic formats which can be placed in Scribus include Encapsulated Post
Script (eps), TIFF(Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG), Portable Network
Graphics (png) and XPixMap(xpm). Scribus now also handles any bit map file
type supported by QT3.

DescUsage: <<
 The online help files are not included in this version.
 To get them, install the scribus-i18n-en package.

 Fonts: By default, the X11 Type1 fonts are recognized. If you
 want more fonts, you can do one or more of the following:
 - Install the x-ghostscript-fonts or msttcorefonts or xfonts-intl
   or applesystemfont packages.
   (The gimp-sharefonts and similar packages work, too,
   but these fonts are of rather bad quality)
 - Put lines like
     /Library/Fonts
     /System/Library/Fonts
   into your ~/.scribus/scribusfont.rc file (create it if it doesn't exist)
   This will give you many (not all) of the Apple system fonts.
   If you have other font collections, put the path to the corresponding 
   directory in this file.
   Not all font types are working: OpenType and Resource Fork TrueType
   don't work, but the latter can be converted using fondu.
<<
DescPort: <<
 The Makefile needs some help for the final linking.
 Plugin compiling overrides some libtool logic, but this is simpler
 than to import the whole KDE admin directory packet.
 The scribus-scripting plugin is contained in this version. Python23 is required for this.
 A function that is declared but never defined has to be removed from
 libprefs/prefs.h.
