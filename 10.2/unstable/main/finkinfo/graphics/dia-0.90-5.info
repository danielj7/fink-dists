Description: Diagram drawing program
DescDetail: <<
Dia is a tool for drawing diagrams, borrowing ideas from programs such
as visio. It can be used to draw specific types of diagrams such as
network and UML diagrams and flowcharts, while also providing some
more generic objects to draw with. Dia may be extended to use new
shape types by writing a simple XML description of the shape. The
diagrams can be exported to a number of formats including EPS, SVG,
CGM and PNG. Diagrams can also be printed (splitting the diagram to
multiple pages if appropriate).
