Description: Tutorial for vi newbies.
DescDetail: <<
vilearn presents a menu of available tutorials for vi. There are five
short tutorials, each a text file intended to be edited with vi.

*  The first, Basic Editing, covers the handful of commands required to
both navigate all five tutorials and do basic editing.
*  The second tutorial, Moving Efficiently, covers all of the cursor
positioning commands. These are the commands used later as arguments to
editing commands.
*  Tutorial three, Cutting and Pasting, introduces the first compound
commands, numbering, and copy buffers.
*  The Inserting Techniques tutorial continues the discussion of
compound commands, while completing the list of insertion commands first
discussed in tutorial one.
*  The final tutorial, Tricks and Timesavers, is less a tutorial than a
description of common vi commands which don't fit correctly into normal
vi logic.

Each user edits their own copy of the tutorial, saved in the directory
VILEARN, in the current directory.
