Description: High level Firewall language
DescDetail: <<
HLFL stands for "High Level Firewall Language". It translates your high level language 
firewalling rules into usable rules for IPChains, NetFilter, IPFilter, Cisco, and many 
others. Renaud Deraison, founder of the Nessus Project, initiated this project first, but 
it is now maintained by Arnaud Launay and discussed on the HLFL mailing-list.


Some examples of how HLFL works may be found in the examples section; the syntax 
is detailed in the syntax section on their web-site and in the doc directory.
