# Additional Info
DescDetail: <<
 psycopg 2 is an almost complete rewrite of psycopg. It still supports
 all the features of psycopg but adds real adaptation for Python to
 PostgreSQL type conversions, asynchronous queries, support for the
 Python built-in datetime module and the new (Python 2.4) Decimal type.
 
 psycopg2 is a PostgreSQL database adapter for the Python programming
 language. It was written from scratch with the aim of being very small
 and fast, and stable as a rock. The main advantages of psycopg2 are
 that it supports the full Python DBAPI-2.0 and being thread safe at
 level 2.

DescPackaging: <<

In order for the -m maintainer tests to work, you need to
run these two commands first:

  createdb psycopg2_test
  createuser root

No need for python-mx date module.  Now uses built in datetime.
