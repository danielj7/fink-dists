Package: arpack-ng%type_pkg[-atlas]
Version: 3.1.0
Revision: 3
Type: -atlas (boolean), gcc(4.6)

Maintainer: Alexander Hansen <alexkhansen@users.sourceforge.net>
Description: Solve large scale eigenvalue problems
DescDetail: <<
ARPACK is a collection of Fortran77 subroutines designed to solve large scale
eigenvalue problems.  It began at Rice university:
http://www.caam.rice.edu/software/ARPACK

The arpack-ng project is a joint project between Debian, Octave and Scilab in 
order to provide a common and maintained version of arpack.

Because no single release has been published by Rice university for the last 
decade and since many software packages (Octave, Scilab, R, Matlab...) have 
forked it and implemented their own modifications, arpack-ng aims to tackle 
this issue by providing a common repository and maintained version.
<<
DescUsage: <<
This package contains static libraries, an unversioned dylib, Fortran 
examples, and documentation.

DescPackaging:  <<
	Needs a gfortran; we're going with gcc46 for now.

	Needs -ff2c when using Accelerate.framework, but not when using
	ATLAS.
	
	3.0.1-1 misbuilt:  it's best _not_ to specify --with-blas and --with-lapack
	when using atlas.
	
	3.1.0:  Doesn't actually understand how _not_ to build with MPI, and it
	seems like a real pain to make it do so, so we'll go ahead and do that.
