Description: Enhanced Programmable ircII Client
DescDetail: <<
The ircII/EPIC program is a unix-based character oriented user agent
('client') to Internet Relay Chat.  It is a fully functional ircII client
with many useful extensions.  This version works with all modern irc
server classes as of early 1999.
<<
DescPort: <<
Patch to use various libiconv*() rather than iconv*() functions which aren't in
Fink's libiconv.

The-idirafter flag in CFLAGS is to work around a conflict between the local term.h and 
the ncurses term.h.

Ignores the directory setting from --with-ssl=[PATH], so have it use system-openssl
until someone gets motivated to change the behavior.

Uses the system's Tcl, and Ruby.  

Currently does not build Perl bindings because it wants to build multi-arch, and 
failed when I (AKH) tried to force it to build single-arch.
