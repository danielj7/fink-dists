ftff, ftwhich and whichman are fault tolerant search utilities.
whichman allows to search for man pages that match approximately the
specified search key. ftff is a fault tolerant file find utility and
ftwhich is a fault tolerant version for the 'which' command. The error
tolerant approximate string match is based on the Levenshtein Distance
between two strings. This is a measure for the number of replacements,
insertions and deletions that are necessary to transform string A into
string B.
