# <AKH> It doesn't actually seem to _link_ tcltk, but uses its

DescPackaging: <<
Pkg in crypto because of preamble of COPYING _ even though
it states explicitly NOT to be part of the licence.
As of 5.15.0-3, build like the prior maxima-nox package:
Separate out the xmaxima package, built against the system's Tcl/Tk,
as a SplitOff.
Move mgnuplot into the xmaxima package as of this version, since it uses the
wish as set from configure.
Previous versions maintained by William McCallum, Matthias Neeracher, and 
Andrea Riciputi.

DescDetail: << 
Maxima is a symbolic computation program. It is full featured, including
symbolic manipulation of polynomials, matrices, rational functions,
integration, Todd-coxeter, 2D and 3D plotting, an ODE solver, and bigfloats.
It contains a symbolic source level debugger for maxima code.
Maxima is based on the original MACsyma developed at MIT in the 1970's.
This package contains the command-line executables, demos, sources,
etc.
<<
DescUsage: <<
Enter "rmaxima" for a command line interface with line editing.  
The "maxima" executable doesn't have this capability now.
"xmaxima" has moved to its own packages.
X11 plotting in gnuplot can be turned on via flags sent to the plot commands.
<<
DescPort: <<
Patch xmaxima.texi so that install-info can work with it.
Force aqua as default gnuplot option.
Given the above, also patch "draw" to understand that by default.
IMPORTANT: Maxima will only reliably work with the version (and
revision) of SBCL that was used to build it. For that reason,
this package has a versioned dependency on Fink's SBCL package,
that needs to be updated, and this package rev-bumped,
any time the sbcl package's version or revision changes.
