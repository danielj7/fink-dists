Description: Puzzle game, resembles Atomix
DescDetail: <<
	LMarbles is an Atomix clone with a slight change in concept.
	Instead of assembling molecules you create figures out of marbles.
	Nevertheless, the basic game play is the same: If a marble starts to
	move it will not stop until it hits a wall or another marble. To make it
	more interesting there are obstacles like one-way streets, crumbling
	walls and portals.
	As Marbles is meant as a puzzle game, you play against a move limit
	and not a time limit. This way you have as much time as you need to think.
