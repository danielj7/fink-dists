Description: Jakarta Commons - Collections
DescDetail: <<
The introduction of the Collections API by Sun in JDK 1.2 has been a boon
to quick and effective Java programming.  Ready access to powerful data
structures has accelerated development by reducing the need for custom
container classes around each core object.  Most Java2 APIs are significantly
easier to use because of the Collections API.

However, there are certain holes left unfilled by Sun's implementations, and
the Jakarta-Commons Collections Component strives to fulfill them.  Among the
features of this package are:

* Special-purpose implementations of Lists and Maps for fast access
* Adapter classes from Java1-style containers (arrays, enumerations) to
  Java2-style collections.
* Methods to test or create typical set-theory properties of collections such
  as union, intersection, and closure.
