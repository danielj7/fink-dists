	Description: JavaScript file and module loader
	DescDetail: <<
RequireJS loads plain JavaScript files as well as more defined
modules. It is optimized for in-browser use, including in a Web
Worker, but it can be used in other JavaScript environments, like
Rhino and Node. It implements the Asynchronous Module API
.
RequireJS uses plain script tags to load modules/files, so it should
allow for easy debugging. It can be used simply to load existing
JavaScript files, so you can add it to your existing project without
having to re-write your JavaScript files.
.
RequireJS includes an optimization tool you can run as part of your
packaging steps for deploying your code. The optimization tool can
combine and minify your JavaScript files to allow for better
performance.
.
If the JavaScript file defines a JavaScript module via define(), then
there are other benefits RequireJS can offer: improvements over
traditional CommonJS modules and loading multiple versions of a
module in a page. RequireJS also has a plugin system that supports
features like i18n string bundles, and text file dependencies.
.
RequireJS does not have any dependencies on a JavaScript
framework. It is dual-licensed -- new BSD or MIT.
.
The standard require.js file is around 5.5KB when minified via
Closure Compiler and gzipped.
.
RequireJS works in IE 6+, Firefox 2+, Safari 3.2+, Chrome 3+, and
Opera 10+.
.
This package also provides a script r.js, that has two major functions:
* Run AMD-based projects in Node and Rhino.
* Includes the RequireJS Optimizer that combines scripts for optimal
  browser delivery.
