DescDetail: <<
ckit is a C front end written in SML that translates C source code
(after preprocessing) into abstract syntax represented as a set of SML
datatypes.  It also provides facilities for extending the C language
with additional syntactic constructs, which can be useful for
implementing "C-like" domain-specific languages as well as C dialects.

Ckit is currently used as the front end for a variety of tools for
static analysis of C code and at least one domain-specific language.
Documentation is still rudimentary at this point.  There is an
overview explaining how to get started, and the signatures of the
major components are commented.
