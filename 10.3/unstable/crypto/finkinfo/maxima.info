DescDetail:<<
Maxima is a descendant of the symbol manipulation program Macsyma, 
which had its roots in the late 1960s at MIT. Its abilities include 
basic algebraic manipulation, symbolic integration, 2D and 3D plotting, 
and an ODE solver.

DescUsage:<<
If you have trouble installing with Fink Commander, try installing from
the command line (and don't divert the output to a file).

Enter "maxima" to get a command line interface, and "xmaxima" to get a
graphical interface under xwindows.

Matthias Neeracher <neeracher@mac.com>: Added version dependency for clisp to 
account for the fact that maxima is not currently compatible with clisp > 2.29
