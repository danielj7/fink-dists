# Additional Data:
DescDetail: <<
This module, when inherited by a package, allows that package's class to
define attribute handler subroutines for specific attributes. Variables
and subroutines subsequently defined in that package, or in packages
derived from that package may be given attributes with the same names as
the attribute handler subroutines, which will then be called at the end
of the compilation phase (i.e. in a `CHECK' block).
