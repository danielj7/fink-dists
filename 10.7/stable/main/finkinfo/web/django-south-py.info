Description: Intelligent schema/data migrations for Django

DescDetail: <<
From http://south.readthedocs.org/en/latest/about.html:

South brings migrations to Django applications. Its main objectives are to
provide a simple, stable and database-independent migration layer to prevent
all the hassle schema changes over time bring to your Django applications.

We try to make South both as easy-to-use and intuitive as possible, by making
it automate most of your schema-changing tasks, while at the same time
providing a powerful set of tools for large or complex projects; you can easily
write your own migrations by hand, or even use the database altering API
directly.

While South started as a relative unknown in the Django
database-schema-altering world, it has slowly risen in popularity and is now
widely regarded as the most popular schema migration tool for Django.
