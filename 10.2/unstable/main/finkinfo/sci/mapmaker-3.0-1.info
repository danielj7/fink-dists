Description: Interactive genetic linkage mapping package
DescDetail: <<
MAPMAKER/EXP is a linkage analysis package designed to help construct
primary linkage maps of markers segregating in experimental crosses.
MAPMAKER/EXP performs full multipoint linkage analysis (simultaneous
estimation of all recombination fractions from the primary data) for
dominant, recessive, and co- dominant (e.g.  RFLP-like) markers.
MAPMAKER/EXP is an experimental-cross-only successor to the original
MAPMAKER program.

MAPMAKER/QTL is a companion program to MAPMAKER/EXP which allows one
to map genes controlling polygenic quantitative traits in F2
intercrosses and BC1 backcrosses relative to a genetic linkage map.
More information on MAPMAKER/QTL can be found in the technical report
(included with MAPMAKER/QTL).

DescPort: <<
Compiled using -D_BIG_DATASETS (allows ca. 5000 loci).

Here's my thoughts on lib/system.h:
  -D_SYS_UNIX (so we don't get DOSish artifacts).
  -DSIGHANDLE=void (from the signal() manpage).
  -DUSE_RANDOM (looks like the correct return type, but gives an
    integer overflow).
  Some -D to get correct typedefs according to the relevant manpages):
    void * calloc(size_t number, size_t size);
    void qsort(void *base, size_t nmemb, size_t size,
               int (*compar)(const void *, const void *));
      (not sure about QSORT_DATA_PTR_TO)
  -DUSE_LIB (/usr/include has all the resulting INC_*-caused  .h files).

Other lib/system.h things:
  Use system maximum-pathlength def (in sys/param.h) for PATH_LENGTH.
  We have strerror().
  We don't (seem to?) have matherror(), but we'll leave HAVE_MATHERR
    defined for now.
  We have getenv() and getcwd() but not chdir(), but let's see what
    happens if we say we go with the default of saying we have 'em all.
  Leaving the "Terminal I/O" stuff as-is for now.
  Removed malloc.h (malloc() is in stdlib.h).
  Removed USE_DRAND48 prototyping (it's in stdlib.h).

lib/iolib.h: /usr/include/stdio.h provides a conflicting prototype for
a (seemingly?) different fgetln() (from libc). Will do a brute-force
renaming and hope for the best.

A lot of calls to make_filename*(), fprint() and fwrite() pass
constant strings as param 3 which get passed to depsace() which tried
to modify them, causing a bus error. Thanks to Alexander Strange, who
notes that -fwritable-strings fixes this deprecated behavior.

Readline is giving problems so we disable it for now.

The xterm wrappers are in sun/ but Makefile forgets to look there so
we link them into the main directory. And we fix a silly typo in them.
