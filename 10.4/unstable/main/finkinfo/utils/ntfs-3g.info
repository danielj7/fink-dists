Description: FUSE NTFS filesystem
DescDetail: <<
	The NTFS-3G driver is an open source, freely available NTFS driver
	for Linux with read and write support. It provides safe and fast
	handling of the Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows 2000 and
	Windows Vista file systems. Most POSIX file system operations are
	supported, with the exception of full file ownership and access
	right support.
<<
DescUsage: <<
	To connect to an NTFS volume:

	First unmount the NTFS disk if currently mounted read-only. You can use
	Disk Utility to do this and also to get the partition. You can also use
	the following script to get a list of available NTFS volumes:

	diskutil list | grep Windows_NTFS

	The last thing on each line should be something like disk1s1 which is
	the disk partition. Prefix it with /dev/ to get the value to pass to
	ntfs-3g. You can use the option -ovolname to specify a name for the
	Finder to display. Example:

	mkdir /Volumes/ntfs
	sudo ntfs-3g /dev/disk1s1 /Volumes/ntfs -ovolname="Windows Disk"

	Be sure to substitute your disk partition for /dev/disk1s1. Using a
	mount point of /Volumes/something allows better integration with the
	Finder. In this example, I'm using /Volumes/ntfs.
	
	To disconnect:

	umount /Volumes/ntfs

	or eject from the Finder.

	See ntfs-3g man page for more options.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
	Changed mount.ntfs-3g symlink to mount_ntfs-3g to match standard on darwin.
	No longer suid root since this isn't supported anymore.
	Disabled shared library since nothing else uses it and the lib version
	keeps changing.
