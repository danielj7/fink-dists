DescDetail: <<
The Predictive Model Markup Language (PMML) is an XML-based language
which provides a way for applications to define statistical and data
mining models and to share models between PMML compliant applications.
More information about PMML and the Data Mining Group can be found at
http://www.dmg.org. The generated PMML can be imported into any PMML
consuming application, such as the Zementis ADAPA and UPPI scoring engines
which allow for predictive models built in R to be deployed and executed
on site, in the cloud (Amazon, IBM, and FICO), in-database (IBM Netezza,
Pivotal, Sybase IQ, Teradata and Teradata Aster) or Hadoop (Datameer and Hive).
