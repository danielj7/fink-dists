DescDetail: <<
The purpose of this library is to provide:
  1. An extensible framework that will support robust 
     spatial indexing methods.
  2. Support for sophisticated spatial queries. Range, 
     point location, nearest neighbor and k-nearest 
     neighbor as well as parametric queries (defined 
     by spatial constraints) should be easy to deploy 
     and run.
  3. Easy to use interfaces for inserting, deleting 
     and updating information.
  4. Wide variety of customization capabilities. Basic 
     index and storage characteristics like the page size, 
     node capacity, minimum fan-out, splitting algorithm, 
     etc. should be easy to customize.
  5. Index persistence. Internal memory and external 
  memory structures should be supported. Clustered and 
  non-clustered indices should be easy to be persisted.
