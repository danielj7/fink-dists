Description: Fantasy adventure game
DescDetail: <<
	Flight of the Amazon Queen is a 2D point-and-click adventure game
	set in the 1940s, originally published for DOS and the Amiga. 
	 You assume the role of Joe King, a pilot for hire who is given the job
	of flying Faye Russell (a famous movie star) into the Amazon jungle
	for a photo shoot. Of course, things never go according to plans. After an
	unfortunate turn of events they find themselves stranded in the heart of the
	Amazon jungle, where Joe will embark on a quest to rescue a kidnapped
	princess and in the process, discover the true sinister intentions of a
	suspiciously located Lederhosen company. In a rich 2D environment, Joe
	will cross paths with a variety of unlikely jungle inhabitants including, but
	not limited to, a tribe of Amazon women and 6-foot-tall pygmies. 
	 Note that this package only contains game-data. The game engine is
	provided by ScummVM.
