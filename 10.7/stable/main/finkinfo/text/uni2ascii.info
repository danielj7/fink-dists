PatchScript: <<
	### patch from MacPorts.  HOWEVER, we are actually *removing* the
	### getline that's included with the package in version=4.9
	### to avoid this error on Lion:
	### ascii2uni.c:817:1: error: conflicting types for 'getline'
	### The included getline is not included with newer upstreams, so can
	### remove the patch after updating to a newer upstream version.
	### If updating uni2ascii in a system earlier than Lion, just reverse
	### the patch, ie *ADD* this getline since Leopard and SL don't have 
	### GNU getline.
	patch -R -p0 < %{PatchFile}

Description: Converts text between Unicode and ASCII
DescDetail: <<
uni2ascii and ascii2uni convert between UTF-8 Unicode and more than a
dozen 7-bit ASCII equivalents including: hexadecimal and decimal HTML
numeric character references, \u-escapes, standard hexadecimal, raw
hexadecimal, and RFC2396 URI format. Such ASCII equivalents are
encountered in a variety of circumstances, such as when Unicode text is
included in program source, when entering text into Web programs that can
handle the Unicode character set but are not 8-bit safe, and when debugging.
<<
DescPort: <<
Lion only: Patch is used to remove internal declaration of GNU getline that's 
in the uni2ascii in version 4.9.  It's applied with -R because the original 
source of the patch is using it to ADD GNU getline into the file for multisystem
build off a single description.  GNU getline is included since Lion.
