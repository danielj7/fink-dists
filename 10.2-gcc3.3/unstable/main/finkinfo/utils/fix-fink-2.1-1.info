Description: Utility to fix libSystem/libpng probs in a fink installation
DescDetail: <<
 This utility was used to fix a few fink problems which couldn't be handled
 with a normal update.  It was relevant in 2002 and early 2003.  It is
 not relevant today, and there is no reason to run it on a modern fink
 installation.
