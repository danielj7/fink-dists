Description: Secure replacement for rm
DescDetail: <<
Unlike the standard rm, srm overwrites the data in the target files before 
unlinking them. This prevents command-line recovery of the data by examining 
the raw block device. It may also help frustrate physical examination of the 
disk, although it's unlikely that it can completely prevent that type of recovery. 
It is, essentially, a paper shredder for sensitive files.
