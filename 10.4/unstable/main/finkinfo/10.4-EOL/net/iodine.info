Description: Tunnels IPv4 data through a DNS server
DescDetail: <<
 This is a piece of software that lets you tunnel IPv4 data through a DNS
 server. This can be usable in different situations where internet access is
 firewalled, but DNS queries are allowed. 
 iodine is similar to nstx but has password authentication, brings up the tun
 interface automatically and lets the user specify the IP address as a command
 line option.
