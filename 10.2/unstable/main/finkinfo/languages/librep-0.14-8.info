Description: Embedable interpreter for a Lisp dialect
DescDetail: <<
librep implements a Lisp dialect called rep. The interpreter can be
run standalone or it can be embeded in applications via a library. The
language can be extended through loadable modules.
<<
DescPort: <<
Uses autoconf and libtool 1.4. Requires some patches to get past
Darwin's linker. The file DOC conflicts with the directory doc on HFS+
volumes; since doc doesn't seem to be used, it is renamed to docs. The
configure script is patched to disable dlmalloc, which also doesn't
get past the linker.

Forces the host_type to be something without an OS version number in
it.

The compiler shipped with Mac OS X 10.1 generates incorrect code when
the default optimization (-O2) is used. We force -O0, which seems to
work so far.

mkdir() doesn't like names that end with a slash. We patch the
make-directory implementation to remove a trailing slash if present
(a mid-range hack :-).

added --libexecdir= flag to comply with fink's policy
