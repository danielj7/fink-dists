Package: tclexpat
Version: 2.6
Revision: 1
Description: XML/expat parsing routines for Tcl scripts
DescPort: <<
There's something weird with file locations between the parent
directory and this one.

The installed headers have generic names so move them into a subdir in
include/ so not conflict with other packages (or be accidentally
loaded in preference to other subdirs). To build against this package,
pass a -I%p/include/%n to your compiler.

This compiles a shared library but does not set the compatibility
version info, nor does it install a .la or the full set of versioned
and versionless links for .dylib files. The whole thing goes in a
private place in lib/ so not going to fix this nor make a -shlibs.
