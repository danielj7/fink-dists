DescDetail: <<
  Tofrodos is a text file conversion utility that converts ASCII files
  between the MSDOS (or Windows) format, which traditionally have CR/LF
  (carriage return/line feed) pairs as their new line delimiters, and the
  Unix format, which usually have LFs (line feeds) to terminate each line.
<<
