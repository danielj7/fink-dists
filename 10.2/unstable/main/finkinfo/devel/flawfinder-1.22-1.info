Description: Examines C/C++ source code for security flaws
License: GPL
DescDetail: <<
 Flawfinder is a python script which scans through C/C++ source code,
 identifying lines ("hits") with potential security flaws. By default it
 reports hits sorted by severity, with the riskiest lines first. It's very
 useful for quickly finding and removing at least some potential security
 problems before a program is widely released to the public.
