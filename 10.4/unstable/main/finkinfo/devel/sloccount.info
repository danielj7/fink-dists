Description: Programs for counting source lines of code
DescDetail: <<
SLOCCount (pronounced "sloc-count") is a suite of programs for
counting physical source lines of code (SLOC) in potentially large
software systems (thus, SLOCCount is a "software metrics tool" or
"software measurement tool"). SLOCCount can count physical SLOC for a
wide number of languages; listed alphabetically, they are: Ada,
Assembly, awk, Bourne shell, C, C++, C shell, COBOL, C#, Erlang,
Expect, Fortran, Java, lex/flex, LISP (including Scheme), Makefile,
Modula3, Objective-C, Pascal, Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby, sed, SQL, Tcl,
Yacc/Bison.

SLOCCount can automatically determine if a file is a source code file
or not, and if so, which language it's written in. As a result, you
can analyze large systems completely automatically. SLOCCount also
includes some report-generating tools to collect the data generated
and present it in several different formats.
