Description: Parity Archive Volume Set II
DescPackaging: <<
 This version is compiled with g++-3.3, even in the 10.4 tree.  If it is
 ever updated to a more recent compiler, any packages which depend on
 this one must be updated at the same time.
<<
DescDetail: <<
The idea behind this project is to provide a tool to apply the data-recovery
 capability concepts of RAID-like systems to the posting and recovery of 
multi-part
 archives on Usenet. Current filespec and clients support the 'Reed-Soloman 
Code'
 implementation that allows for recovery of any 'X' volumes for 'X' parity 
volumes present.
 .
 The key to this mission is a clean file format specification which provides 
all the
 necessary capabilities for programs to easily verify and regenerate single 
missing parts
 out of a set of archives.
 .
 We might just be able to make binary posting and downloading on Usenet a 
little easier.
 That's a pretty cool goal!
