Description: Library for creating Postscript documents

DescDetail: <<
libLASi is a library written by Larry Siden that provides a C++ stream
output interface ( with operator << ) for creating Postscript documents
that can contain characters from any of the scripts and symbol blocks
supported in Unicode and by Owen Taylor's Pango layout engine. The
library accomodates right-to-left scripts such as Arabic and Hebrew as
easily as left-to-right scripts. Indic and Indic-derived Complex Text
Layout (CTL) scripts, such as Devanagari, Thai, Lao, and Tibetan are
supported to the extent provided by Pango and by the OpenType fonts
installed on your system. All of this is provided without need for any
special configuration or layout calculation on the programmer's part.
Although the capability to produce Unicode-based multilingual Postscript
documents exists in large Open Source application framework libraries
such as GTK+, QT, and KDE, libLASi was designed for projects which
require the ability to produce Postscript independent of any one
application framework.
