Description: Circuit drawing app with schematic capture
DescUsage: <<
 In some cases XCircuit uses cursors which are bigger than 16x16. In the
 current version of XFree86, this does not work in rootless mode. Hence
 you might want to switch to fullscreen mode when using xcircuit.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
Needed to add -fno-common to CFLAGS.
Added -I/usr/X11R6/include to CFLAGS because it wouldn't work with 
CPPFLAGS.  This is needed because the linker apparently can't find
the X11 headers by default on XFree86 or Xorg.
