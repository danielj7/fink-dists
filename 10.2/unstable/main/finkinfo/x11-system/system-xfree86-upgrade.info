!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ERROR !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!


You have an old (broken) system-xfree86 package installed.  Unfortunately,
because of bugs that the foolish maintainer never noticed in this package,
there is no way to create an automatic upgrade path to the new, fixed
package(s).

To rectify this grievous affront to your non-interactivity, you will need
to force-remove the existing system-xfree86.  To do so, you can run the
following command in a terminal:

  sudo dpkg -r --force-depends system-xfree86

...and then install the new system-xfree86:

  fink install system-xfree86

I'm sorry about the inconvenience, there's no other way around this.  :(
