Description: Web service enhancement tool
DescDetail: <<
Enunciate is a build-time Web service enhancement tool that can be applied to
Java-based projects for generating a lot of cool artifacts from the source code
of your Web service endpoints.
<<

DescPackaging: <<
The CompileScript downloads a _lot_ of files from the Maven repository. Maybe
we should bundle all these files in a Source2? TODO: find out what files are
downloaded, and how to pack and unpack them in such a way that we can fool
ant/maven into thinking it's already got everything and doesn't need to
download new files.
