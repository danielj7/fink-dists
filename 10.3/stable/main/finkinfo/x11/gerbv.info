Description: Gerber (RS-274D/RS274X) CAM file viewing tool
DescDetail: <<
Gerber Viewer (gerbv) is a viewer for Gerber files. Gerber files
are generated from PCB CAD system and sent to PCB manufacturers
as basis for the manufacturing process. 

This is the stable branch, using GTK+1. New features and GTK+2 support will
be in another Fink package.

A new feature as of 0.16 is the inclusion of a scheme interpreter, which
enables support for "project files" to provide default settings
every time the viewer is invoked.
