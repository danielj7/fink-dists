Description: Modules for importing hdf5 files into opendx 
ConfigureParams: --with-hdf5-incdir=%p/include --datadir=%p/share/dx
InstallScript: <<
make install DESTDIR=%d
<<
DescDetail: <<
The package contains two OpenDX modules:
The ImportHDF5Field module imports a field or a slab of a field from an HDF5
file. The field can be either scalar or vector and must be described on a 
regular grid. The ImportHDF5Species module imports from an HDF5 file particles
which satisfy the user's conditions.
<<
DescUsage:<<
The script %p/bin/dxhd5 automatically loads the hdf5 module description files.
Sample nets are located in %p/share/dx/samples/moduleTryOut. Run dx from 
that directory-- certain sample filenames are hard coded into the sample
programs.
<<
DescPort:<<
Changed the install locations to comply with fink. Rewrote some of the scripts 
to take advantage of these new locations.
