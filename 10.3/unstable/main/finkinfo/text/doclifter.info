Description: Convert man pages to DocBook format
DescDetail: <<
The doclifter program translates documents written in troff
macros to DocBook. Lifting documents from presentation level to
semantic level is hard, and a really good job requires human
polishing. This tool aims to do everything that can be
mechanized, and to preserve any troff-level information that
might have structural implications in XML comments
