DescDetail: <<
Mindless Automaton is a virtual tabletop on which you can play card games
against other people over a network.  It was designed to simulate the
Magic: The Gathering(R) game, but it can be expanded to simulate other games.
Mindless Automaton was very, very inspired by the popular Windows program
Apprentice.
<<
DescUsage: <<
The first time you run Mindless Automaton, you will be asked to load a magic
card database. This could be two kind of file:
+ a cardinfo.dat
+ an Oracle Cards Reference

The first one is the same file used by Apprentice to store card information.
You can get it from an Apprentice installation or from any electronic
tournament site like e-league (http://www.e-league.com/).

The second one is the card reference list provided by Wizards Of The Coast,
you can find the text version under the DCI section of the official website
(http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dci/oracle) or from Mindless Automaton
web site (http://mindless.sourceforge.net/). Always remember to use the Text
version and not the Word Doc.

Fink will provide you the latest Magic: The Gathering Oracle Card Reference,
it is installed under /sw/share/mindless/oracle.txt
However you can play with different CCGs downloading new card references.
