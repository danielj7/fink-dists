Description: Synchronize filesystems between hosts
DescDetail: <<
rsync is a replacement for rcp (and scp) that has many
more features. It uses the "rsync algorithm" which provides a very
fast method for remote files into sync. It does this by sending just
the differences in the files across the link, without requiring that
both sets of files are present at one of the ends of the link
beforehand.
