DocFiles: bitchx-docs/7_Docs/Copyright README
Description: Advanced Internet Relay Chat (IRC) client
DescDetail: <<
This is the bleeding edge of IRC software -- the most common functions normally done by scripts are coded into the client itself. It contains dozens of features such as:

    * Built-in ANSI color (this is probably the biggest feature)
    * Ease of use -- dozens of useful command aliases to reduce typing
    * Built-in notify, protection, and bot lists
    * Built-in mass commands and tools
    * Extended set of DCC commands and built-in CDCC offering
    * Extended scripting functionality, including unique functions
    * Code is based on ircII-Plutonium and more recent ircII-EPiC
<<
DescPackaging: <<
* All help & man files are bzip2 compressed. At least for the man page, this has to be prevented
* The "%p/bin/BitchX" symlink has to be remade, otherwise it point to %i
* Changed some default options, includeing flood_kick after 10, and DISPLAY_PC_CHARACTERS 3, for the terminal in Jaguar
* Disabled the europa plugin, it requires MySQL and has some build issues
<<
DescUsage <<
If versions before 1.019c-4 was used, please make sure %p/etc/bitchx and %p/lib/bitchx/script are working correctly. if they are not, please move them out of the way and reinstall bitchx.
