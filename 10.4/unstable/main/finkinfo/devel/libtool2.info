Description: Shared library build helper, v2.2
DescDetail: <<
GNU libtool knows how to build shared libraries on a wide range of
platforms. It is designed to work with autoconf to add painless shared
library support to GNU packages.

libtool-2.2 is a major change from libtool-1.5. On darwin shared
libraries built with this version will have only one symlink
libfoo.dylib -> libfoo.2.dylib, not two links like on branch-1-5.
There are many many major changes in this version, and very likely
some bugs, please let me know if you come across any.
<<
DescPort: <<
Uses a 'g' prefix to avoid a naming conflict with Apple's libtool
program (which is completely unrelated).
