Description: Handy tool for manipulating PDF
DescDetail: <<
       If  PDF  is  electronic paper, then pdftk is an electronic
       staple-remover, hole-punch,  binder,  secret-decoder-ring,
       and  X-Ray-glasses.   Pdftk  is  a  simple  tool for doing
       everyday things with PDF documents.  Use it to:

       * Merge PDF Documents
       * Split PDF Pages into a New Document
       * Decrypt Input as Necessary (Password Required)
       * Encrypt Output as Desired
       * Fill PDF Forms with FDF Data and/or Flatten Forms
       * Apply a Background Watermark
       * Report PDF Metrics such as Metadata and Bookmarks
       * Update PDF Metadata
       * Attach Files to PDF Pages or the PDF Document
       * Unpack PDF Attachments
       * Burst a PDF Document into Single Pages
       * Uncompress and Re-Compress Page Streams
       * Repair Corrupted PDF (Where Possible)

DescPort: <<
in pdftk/Makefile.OSX, set path to gnu gcc4.2 and use g++-4
use man and html docu from debian/

Under 10.6, must use gcc4.5 since gcj from earlier versions does not
work on 10.6.

Also under 10.6, got a new patch from http://bugs.gentoo.org/attachment.cgi?id=191725&action=view (implemented in PatchScript)
<<

DescPackaging: <<
This package requires gcc42. It does not build with gcc43 or newer.
AFAIK, the problem with pdftk is that it illegally mixes C++ and Java  
exceptions. gcc 4.2 was nice enough to compile it somehow, and at   
least it worked. The newer gcc 4.3 just spits out the error msg and  
stops. The latest version is from 2006.
