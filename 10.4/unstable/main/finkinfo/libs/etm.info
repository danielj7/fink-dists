DescDetail: <<
The Exception and Termination Manager (ETM) is a simple(-minded)
library to manage exceptional conditions that arise during program 
execution, and to provide for orderly program shutdown.
<<
DescPort: <<
Uses it's own local msub (written by RangerRick) to build because something was rotten when using the fink 'msub' for this particular package.  Does not need to BuildConflicts on msub.
