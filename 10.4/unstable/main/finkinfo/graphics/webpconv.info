Description: Webp conversion tool
DescDetail: <<
	WebP is a method of lossy compression that can be used on photographic
	images. The degree of compression is adjustable so a user can choose
	the trade-off between file size and image quality.

	A WebP file consists of VP8 image data, and a container based on RIFF.
	Webmasters, web developers and browser developers can use the WebP
	format to create smaller, better looking images that can help make the
	web faster.

DescUsage: <<
Using webpconv to convert images

Use webpconv on the command line to convert files to WebP or another format.

The webpconv command has the following syntax:

webpconv [-output_dir dir] [-format format] [-quality quality] input_file(s)

Arguments

-output_dir

Path to directory where files are placed. If no path is specified, files
are created in the input directory.

-format

Output image format. Valid formats are: BMP, JPEG, PNG, WEBP.

-quality

Integer. Parameter that specifies the trade off between the file size and
the quality of the output image. The range is from 0 to 100; 100 is the
best image quality with the largest file size. If no value is specified,
the default quality value corresponds to a target peak signal-to-noise
ratio (PSNR) value of 42. A PSNR value of 42 is usually regarded as a good
quality image.

Examples

You can convert a PNG image in /home/user/images/ to a WebP image with a
quality range of 80 with the command:

webpconv -quality 80 /home/user/images/img.png

You can convert a group of WebP images in /home/user/images/ to PNG and
place them in the /tmp folder with the command:

webpconv -output_dir /tmp -format PNG /home/user/images/*.webp
