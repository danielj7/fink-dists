DescDetail: << 
These files work "out of the box" but the template files
can be modified as follows. (The /sw/etc/zsh/zshenv and
/sw/etc/zsh/zshrc should not have to be modified.  If you
have to modify these, please report this as a bug.)
.
1. Issue sudo mkdir -p /Library/init/zsh/local-functions
.
2. Copy any file you want to modify from 
/sw/share/zsh/templates/Library/init/zsh into 
/Library/init/zsh and then edit it there.  That 
file will now be read INSTEAD OF the corresponding 
file in /sw/share/zsh/templates/Library/init/zsh.  
Anything that appears in /Users/$USER/Library/init/zsh 
will be read IN ADDITION TO the other files. The directories 
/sw/share/zsh/templates/Library/init/zsh/local-functions 
and /Library/init/zsh/local-functions are both in the 
$FPATH by default; a funtion of the same name in 
/Library/init/zsh/local-functions takes precedence over that 
in /sw/share/zsh/templates/Library/init/zsh/local-functions.  
This structure permits customizations that will be preserved 
during fink package upgrade.  Example:  If you hate the
multi-colored elaborate prompt, simply create a file called
/Library/init/zsh/prompt and customize your own, or copy
/sw/share/zsh/templates/Library/init/zsh/prompt to that location
to use my very simple version.
.
3. To use with /bin/zsh, copy or link the file
/sw/share/zsh/templates/etc/zshenv to /etc/zshenv and
likewise with /sw/share/zsh/templates/etc/zshrc to
/etc/zshrc.  These two files are both required and have been
designed in such a way that the should not require editing.
.
4. To enable a faster-loading "open" completion, type the
command "enable_faster_open".  This requires an up-to-date
locate database to find the various Applications. 
.
Modifications and enhancements of zsh distributed templates 
were written by Gary Kerbaugh, W. G. Scott, Wataru Kagawa 
and several others. Completion functions _open, _fink, 
_hdiutils, _defaults and their dependencies were written by
Motoi Washida and will be included by default in future versions
of zsh.
.
A brief description of the functions and completions
provided can be had by typing "help_template_functions"
optionally with the function name.  Only a subset are
autoloaded by default.  Load others individually by
uncommenting "autoload -U foo" lines or setting the appropriate
vairables indicated in the file functions.local.
