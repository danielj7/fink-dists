Description: Sophisticated world clock for X11
DescDetail: <<
Sunclock displays a map of the Earth and shows which portion is illuminated by the sun. 
In addition to providing local time for the default timezone, it also displays GMT time,
legal and solar time of major cities, their latitude and longitude, sunrise and sunset,
and the mutual distances of arbitrary locations on Earth. 
Sunclock can display meridians, parallels, tropics, and arctic circles. 
It has builtin functions that accelerate the speed of time and show the evolution of seasons.

Downloading the enhanced earth maps is reccomended. Set options in ~/.sunclockrc.
