Description: GNU documentation system
DescDetail: <<
Texinfo is a documentation system that can render a single source file
into many representations for both on-line and print use. This package
contains both the generation utilities and the standalone 'info'
reader for the Info format.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
The TeX files (texinfo.tex, txi-??.tex and epsf.tex) are not installed
right now. The teTeX package already has them.

Fink uses Debian's version of install-info (in the dpkg package);
texinfo's version is not installed.

AKH: Was encoding whatever "*awk" was found at configure time.
Explicitly use /usr/bin/awk rather than forcing a dependency on gawk.

dmacks: perlvarianted because it uses XS internally

dmacks: --disable-static (ignored by some ./configure but handled by
the XS suite, which is the only internal compiled library)
