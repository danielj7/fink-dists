Description: Project Revision Control System
DescDetail: <<
PRCS is the front end to a set of tools that (like CVS) provide a way to
deal with sets of files and directories as an entity, preserving
coherent versions of the entire set.

PRCS was designed primarily by Professor P. N. Hilfinger, with input and
modifications by Luigi Semenzato and Joshua MacDonald.  PRCS is written
and maintained by Joshua MacDonald.

Its purpose is similar to that of SCCS, RCS, and CVS, but (according to
its authors, at least), it is much simpler than any of those systems.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
  The external gcc3patch from v1.3.2 is now incorporated into the
  upstream.

  Force paths to system binaries so we get consistent build with
  minimal dependencies.

  Disable compiled emacs .elc files.

  This version is compiled with g++-3.3, even in the 10.4 tree.  If it is
  ever updated to a more recent compiler, any packages which depend on
  this one must be updated at the same time.
