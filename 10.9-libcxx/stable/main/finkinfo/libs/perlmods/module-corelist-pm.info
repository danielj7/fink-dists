# Documentation.
DescDetail: <<
A database and command-line tool for identifying which version of each
perl module was shipped with each version of perl.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
	All dependencies are currently satisfied by perl core on all
	supported perl versions, but keep varianted because it always
	has been and someday may need varianted deps again and because
	it's dual-lifed in the intrinsically varianted perl core.
