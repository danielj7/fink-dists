Description: Specializing compiler for Python
DescDetail: <<
Think of Psyco as a kind of just-in-time (JIT) compiler, a little bit like
what exists for other languages, that emit machine code on the fly instead of
interpreting your Python program step by step. The difference with the
traditional approach to JIT compilers is that Psyco writes several version of
the same blocks (a block is a bit of a function), which are optimized by being
specialized to some kinds of variables (a "kind" can mean a type, but it is
more general). The result is that your unmodified Python programs run faster.

Benefits
2x to 100x speed-ups, typically 4x, with an unmodified Python interpreter and
unmodified source code, just a dynamically loadable C extension module.

Drawbacks
Psyco currently uses a lot of memory. It only runs on Intel 386-compatible
processors (under any OS) right now. There are some subtle semantic
differences (i.e. bugs) with the way Python works; they should not be apparent
in most programs.
