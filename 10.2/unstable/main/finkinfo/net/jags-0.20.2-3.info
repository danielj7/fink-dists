Description: Gtk+ based samba client
DescDetail: <<
Jags is a Gtk+ based windows network neighbourhood browser. The
program parses the output from smbclient (part of the samba-package)
and use this to display a graphic view of the network. This
program does the parsing with help from shell- scripts. This means
that it's easy to change the functionality of the program.
<<
DescPort: A patch to allow jags to find the rest of the installation.
