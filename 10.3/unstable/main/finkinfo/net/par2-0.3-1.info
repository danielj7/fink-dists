Description: Parity Archive Volume Set II
DescDetail: <<
The idea behind this project is to provide a tool to apply the data-recovery
 capability concepts of RAID-like systems to the posting and recovery of multi-part
 archives on Usenet. Current filespec and clients support the 'Reed-Soloman Code'
 implementation that allows for recovery of any 'X' volumes for 'X' parity volumes present.
 .
 The key to this mission is a clean file format specification which provides all the
 necessary capabilities for programs to easily verify and regenerate single missing parts
 out of a set of archives.
 .
 We might just be able to make binary posting and downloading on Usenet a little easier.
 That's a pretty cool goal!
