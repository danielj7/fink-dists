Description: Cartoon aquarium GNOME applet
DescDetail: <<
Gnome applet that gives you an aquarium with randomly selected fish (and a turtle)
that take care of themselves - no feeding, no cleaning and so on. 
Additionally it has temperature scale on the right side which shows CPU load. 
It can also be configured to display the time and show the status of numlock, 
capslock and scrollock. The fish are done by Jim Toomey, the author of the 
"Sherman's Lagoon" comics. 
<<
DescUsage: <<
After installation, right click on your GNOME toolbar and select the aquarium under
Amusements.
