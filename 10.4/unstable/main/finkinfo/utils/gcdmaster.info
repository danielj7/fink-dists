Description: Gtk interface for cdrdao
DescDetail: <<
Writes audio CD-Rs in disc-at-once (DAO) mode allowing control over
pre-gaps (length down to 0, nonzero audio data) and sub-channel
information like ISRC codes. All data that is written to the disc must
be specified with a text file. Audio data may be in WAVE or raw format.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
 This version is compiled with g++-3.3, even in the 10.4 tree.  If it is
 ever updated to a more recent compiler, it must be updated at the same time
 as a large collection of packages: gabber, gabber-ssl, gcdmaster,
 genes, glademm, gnomemm, gtkmm, libsigc++ and anything which depends on any 
 of them.
<<
DescUsage: <<
Must manually configure burner, scanbus does not work, read the man page and Readme.macosx :-)
Hint: use IOCompactDiscServices as the first burner, IOCompactDiscServices/2 as the second, etc.
