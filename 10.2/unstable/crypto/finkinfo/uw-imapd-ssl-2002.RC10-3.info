Description: Remote mail folder access server
DescDetail: <<
 IMAP (the Interactive Mail Access Protocol) is a mechanism for
 accessing mail folders and the messages in them remotely, i.e. with
 your user mail program running on a different machine to the one
 where all the messages are stored.

 This server has SSL support built in and includes a POP server with
 the ability to relay commands to an IMAP server.

 You may find this useful with Mac OS X 10.2 (Jaguar) since Apple's
 Mail 1.2 (v544/543) no longer allows local unix mailbox accounts.

 If you installed the 'pine' mail client then an imapd and ipopd
 binaries have already been installed too. In that case you need not
 install this package unless you need the additional 'mailutil' binary
 and other utilities. Unfortunately UW does not provide pine and imapd
 packages that have no overlap of products (or even a full overlap,
 which would make it easier for maintainers to add complete splitoff
 packages).

 If you do install uw-imapd you will almost certainly want to install
 a Mail Transfer Agent such as Smail or Sendmail, as remote mail
 programs which use IMAP to access incoming and saved mail will
 usually want to send mail using SMTP, often to the same machine.

DescUsage: <<
 To install a self-signed certificate (perfectly adequate for personal
 use), perform the following commands:

 sudo mkdir -p /sw/etc/ssl/
 sudo openssl req -new -x509 -nodes -out /sw/etc/ssl/imapd.pem -keyout\
 /sw/etc/ssl/imapd.pem -days 3650

 To enable the IMAP daemon:

 1. Add a line to inetd.conf:
 imaps stream tcp nowait root /usr/libexec/tcpd /sw/sbin/imapd

 (See the enclosed SSLBUILD document for similar instructions to setup
 the additional pop daemons.)

 2. Reset (HUP) inetd:
 sudo kill -HUP `cat /var/run/inetd.pid`

 Unfortunately no instructions were provided with imapd to configure
 xinetd (a modern replacement for inetd, included with Mac OS X 10.2).
 To use imapd with xinetd, create the file '/etc/xinetd.d/imaps' and
 insert the following:

service imaps
{
	disable		= no
	flags		= REUSE
	socket_type	= stream
	protocol	= tcp
	wait		= no
	user		= root
	groups		= yes
	server		= /sw/sbin/imapd
}

 If xinetd is not already running, start it with the following
 command:
     sudo /usr/sbin/xinetd
 If xinetd is already running, restart it with:
     sudo kill -HUP `cat /var/run/xinetd.pid`

 IMPORTANT: DO NOT CONFIGURE BOTH inetd AND xinetd FOR imapd!

DescPackaging: <<
 UW has a bad habit of changing the naming convention of new builds! (Argh.)

 Removed SSLTYPE=nopwd from the CompileScript, it is now the default
 build setting as of RC7.
 
 Better way to install DocFiles subdirectories?
