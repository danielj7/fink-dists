Description: Opengl utility toolkit
DescDetail: <<
Freeglut is a completely OpenSourced alternative to the OpenGL Utility 
Toolkit (GLUT) library released under the X-Consortium license. The
original GLUT library seems to have been abandoned with the most recent
version (3.7) dating back to August 1998. Its license does not allow 
anyone to distribute modified library code. Freeglut is actively
developed and doesn't suffer the license restrictions. The goal is
to gradually depreciate the current glut package out of fink replacing
it with freeglut.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
This package is NOT binary compatible with glut/glut-shlibs and can not
replace for them. Packages that wish to use freeglut as a replacement
for glut cannot have "BuildDepends: glut|freeglut" and "Depends:
glut-shlibs|freeglut-shlibs" in their info file, but need to pick one
self-consistently.

This package builds the freeglut libraries named as freeglut rather than
glut to allow the co-existance with glut since the shared library versioning
is identical. I have adopted the use of symlinks for the libraries and 
headers to allow freeglut to used as a drop in replace for glut without
requiring changes in the source code of programs which require glut.

Patch fixes crash in flightgear (taken from RH's Fedora 7 package).
