DescDetail: <<
Fit generalized linear models with binomial responses using either
an adjusted-score approach to bias reduction or maximum penalized
likelihood where penalization is by Jeffreys invariant prior.
These procedures return estimates with improved frequentist properties
(bias, mean squared error) that are always finite even in cases where
the maximum likelihood estimates are infinite (data separation).
Fitting takes place by fitting generalized linear models on iteratively
updated pseudo-data. The interface is essentially the same as 'glm'.
More flexibility is provided by the fact that custom pseudo-data
representations can be specified and used for model fitting. Functions
are provided for the construction of confidence intervals for the
reduced-bias estimates.
