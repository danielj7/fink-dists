DescDetail: <<
 CXmame is a simple console based frontend for xmame, written in C
 using the ncurses library.

 I started building this because I thought it would be nice to have a
 console based frontend for xmame.svgalib, especially for people who
 want to run xmame on a machine without X. But I suppose something
 like this is ideal for someone who just wants a minimal frontend--I
 like typing the game names to jump to them in the menu ;=)
