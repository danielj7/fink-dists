DescDetail: <<
 Netrik is an advanced text mode WWW browser. Its purpose is to give access to
 as much of the Web as possible in text mode, without forsaking any comfort.
 The user interface is looking roughly like a combination of gVim and PINE.
 Some of the core ideas (not all implemented yet):
   Context-(URL-)sensitive setup
   Partially loaded pages
   Half-graphical mode
   Efficient navigation
   Key mapping and macros (similar to vi and mutt)
   Command prompt, menus and online help
