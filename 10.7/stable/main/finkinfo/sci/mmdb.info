DescDetail: << 
MMDB is CCP4\'s macromolecular coordinate library, written by Eugene
Krissinel of the EBI.  The Coordinate Library is designed to assist
CCP4 developers in working with coordinate files. The major source of
coordinate information remains the PDB files, although more
information becomes available in mmCIF format.

The Library features working with both file formats plus an internal
binary format portable between different platforms. This is achieved
at uniformity of the Library\'s interface functions, so that there is
no difference in handling different formats.

The Library provides various high-level tools for working with
coordinate files, which include not only reading and writing, but also
orthogonal-fractional coordinate transforms, generation of symmetry
mates, editing the molecular structure and some others. The Library is
supposed as a general low-level tool for unifying the
coordinate-related operations.
