Description: Automated text generation from templates
DescDetail: <<
AutoGen is a tool designed to simplify the creation and maintenance of
programs that contain large amounts of repetitious text. It is
especially valuable in programs that have several blocks of text that
must be kept synchronized.

AutoGen includes several modules for specific applications, including
a command line option parser, an FSM generator, a generator for
autoconf macros and others.
<<
DescUsage: <<
The AutoGen package is composed of one main program (autogen) and
several helpers. The autogen command takes as input a text file
containing structured information (the AutoGen definition) and a
template containing instructions for turning the structured input into
formatted output. The columns command generates columnized tables from
its input. The getdefs command extracts an AutoGen definition from
source files.

The development package includes a couple of useful libraries: the
options library for simplifying the task of managing a program's
command line options, and the snprintvf library for generating safe
printf-style output from argv-style arguments.

See the man or info pages (autogen, snprintfv) for more usage information.
<<
DescPort: <<
Autogen includes a module for generating autogen files from xml, xml2ag. The
xml2ag files are part of a split-off package so that the main autogen
package does not depend on libxml. This module is compiled if and only
if you already have libxml2 installed.

Note: -no-cpp-precomp is not used on purpose -- even though many
compiler warnings could be avoided -- because it's definition causes
the CPPFLAGS assignment (-no-cpp-precomp -I/sw/include) to include a
space, which breaks the recursive configure for sub-directories.

DescPackaging: <<
  guile: bdep on guile18 which contains guile18-build
  switched over to guile18, was guile (1.4) before 5.10.
  VPATH build fails b/c documentation generation fails to use top_srcdir.
