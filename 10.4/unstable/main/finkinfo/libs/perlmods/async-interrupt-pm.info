Description: Allow C/XS libs to interrupt perl async
DescDetail: <<
	This module implements a single feature only of interest to advanced
	perl modules, namely asynchronous interruptions (think "UNIX signals",
	which are very similar).
	
	Sometimes, modules wish to run code asynchronously (in another thread,
	or from a signal handler), and then signal the perl interpreter on
	certain events. One common way is to write some data to a pipe and use
	an event handling toolkit to watch for I/O events. Another way is to
	send a signal. Those methods are slow, and in the case of a pipe, also
	not asynchronous - it won't interrupt a running perl interpreter.
	
	This module implements asynchronous notifications that enable you to
	signal running perl code from another thread, asynchronously, and
	sometimes even without using a single syscall.
