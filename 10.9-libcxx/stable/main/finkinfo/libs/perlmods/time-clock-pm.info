DescDetail: <<
A Time::Clock object is a twenty-four hour clock with nanosecond precision and
wrap-around.  It is a clock only; it has absolutely no concept of dates.
Vagaries of date/time such as leap seconds and daylight savings time are
unsupported.

When a Time::Clock object hits 23:59:59.999999999 and at least one more
nanosecond is added, it will wrap around to 00:00:00.000000000.  This works in
reverse when time is subtracted.

Time::Clock objects automatically stringify to a user-definable format.
