Description: Gmerlin Audio Video Library
DescDetail: <<
Gavl is short for Gmerlin Audio Video Library. 
It is a low level library, upon which multimedia APIs can be built. 
Gavl handles all the details of audio and video formats like colorspaces, 
samplerates, multichannel configurations etc. It provides standardized 
definitions for those formats as well as container structures for carrying 
Audio samples or Video frames. 
In addition, it handles the sometimes ugly task to convert between all these 
formats as well as some elemtary operations (scaling, alpha blending etc). 
This package provides the the run-time library.
