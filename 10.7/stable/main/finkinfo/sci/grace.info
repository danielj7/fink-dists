Description: Data processing and 2-D visualization tool
DescDetail: <<
Grace is a Motif/Lesstif application for two-dimensional data
visualization. Grace can transform the data using free equations, FFT,
cross- and auto-correlation, differences, integrals, histograms, and
much more. The generated figures are of high quality. Grace is a very
convenient tool for data inspection, data transformation, and for
making figures for publications.
<<
DescUsage:  <<
The graphical executable name is "xmgrace".

The default help viewer is "open", i.e. whatever the default browser you have
yoursystem set to, and the default editor is nano (because I thought it was 
the most user-friendly default option).
You can override the default help viewer and editor settings via the
GRACE_HELPVIEWER and GRACE_EDITOR environment variables, respectively.
For example, if you're running GraceGTK in a remote X11 session, you'll 
probably want an X11-based help viewer, e.g. an X11 firefox from Fink:

	env GRACEGTK_HELPVIEWER='firefox %s' ggrace
<<
DescPort: <<
Configure test for isnan_decl fails - patch includes config.cache
to force the issue.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
Patch to doc/Makefile to force install of man pages in %p/share/man.

As of 5.1.22-9: 
Since we install the convcal manpage, might as well
actually put a convcal symlink in %p/bin.  We use update-alternatives
since convcal can be provided either by this package or gracegtk.
