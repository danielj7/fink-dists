Description: Toolkit for generation of output for the web
DescDetail: <<

Genshi is a Python library that provides an integrated set of
components for parsing, generating, and processing HTML, XML or other
textual content for output generation on the web.

The main feature is a template language that is smart about markup:
unlike conventional template languages that only deal with bytes and
(if you're lucky) characters, Genshi knows the difference between
tags, attributes, and actual text nodes, and uses that knowledge to
your advantage. For example:

    * Intelligent automatic escaping greatly reduces the risk of
      opening up your site to cross-site scripting attacks (XSS).

    * Template directives are often less verbose than those in most
      other template languages, as they can be attached directly to
      the elements they act upon.

    * Independence from a specific serialization format lets you
      instantly switch between generating well-formed HTML 4.01 and
      XHTML 1.0 (or other formats).

    * Stream-based filtering allows you to apply various
      transformations as a template is being processed, without having
      to parse and serialize the output again.

    * Match templates let you enforce a common structure on template
      output, and more. This, in combination with XInclude support, is
      used instead of the more rigid inheritance feature commonly
      found in other template languages.

For those cases where you don't want to generate markup, Genshi also
provides a simple text-based template language.
