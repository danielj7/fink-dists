Package: gtk+
Version: 1.2.10
Revision: 20
Depends: x11, glib, %N-shlibs (=%v-%r), %N-data (=%v-%r)
BuildDepends: fink (>= 0.9.9), gettext-dev, gettext-bin, x11-dev
DescPackaging: <<
  Uses pkgconfig.
  Any package which BuildDepends on this one must also BuildDepend on:
    glib

A file was renamed since 1.2.8, changing only case. The preinst script
is used to allow a clean upgrade.

This package creates symlinks to the include files, which have moved
since version 1.2.8. This eliminates the need to rebuild dependent
libraries which saved the include path in their *-config scripts. It
prevents parallel installation of version 2.0, though.

Shared memory support is disabled, since it doesn't work in Darwin.
