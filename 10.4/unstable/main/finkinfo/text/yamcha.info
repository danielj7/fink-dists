Description: Yet Another Multipurpose CHunk Annotator
DescDetail: <<
YamCha is a generic, customizable, and open source text chunker oriented
toward a lot of NLP tasks, such as POS tagging, Named Entity Recognition, base
NP chunking, and Text Chunking. YamCha is using a state-of-the-art machine
learning algorithm called Support Vector Machines (SVMs), first introduced by
Vapnik in 1995.

YamCha is exactly the same system which performed the best in the CoNLL2000
Shared Task, Chunking and BaseNP Chunking task.
