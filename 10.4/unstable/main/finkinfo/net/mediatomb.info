DescDetail: <<
MediaTomb is an open source (GPL) UPnP MediaServer with a nice web
user interface, it allows you to stream your digital media through
your home network and listen to/watch it on a variety of UPnP
compatible devices.

MediaTomb implements the UPnP MediaServer V 1.0 specification that
can be found on http://www.upnp.org/. The current implementation
focuses on parts that are required by the specification, however we
look into extending the functionality to cover the optional parts of
the spec as well.

MediaTomb should work with any UPnP compliant MediaRenderer.
