DescDetail: <<
With this package, it is possible to perform (simultaneous) inferences
for ratios of linear combinations of coefficients in the general linear
model. In particular, tests and confidence interval estimations for
ratios of treatment means in the normal one-way layout and confidence
interval estimations like in (multiple) slope ratio and parallel line
assays can be carried out. Moreover, it is possible to calculate the
sample sizes required in comparisons with a control based on relative
margins. For the simple two-sample problem, functions for a t-test for
ratio-formatted hypotheses and the corresponding Fieller-type confidence
interval are provided assuming homogeneous or heterogeneous group variances.
