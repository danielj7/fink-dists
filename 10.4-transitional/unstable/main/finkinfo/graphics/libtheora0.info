Description: Open-source video compression library
DescDetail: <<
Theora is an open video codec being developed by the Xiph.org Foundation
as part of their Ogg project (It is a project that aims to integrate
On2's VP3 video codec, Ogg Vorbis audio codec and Ogg multimedia
container formats into a multimedia solution that can compete with
MPEG-4 format). 

Theora is derived directly from On2's VP3 codec; currently the two are
nearly identical, varying only in framing headers, but Theora will
diverge and improve from the main VP3 development lineage as time
progresses.
