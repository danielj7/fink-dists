DescDetail: <<
Libarchive is a stream-oriented library for variety of archives.
It focuses on tar format and its variants primarily, but can also
read and/or write other families of archive formats.

Following formats are supported ('r' for reading and 'w' for writing).
On read, compression and format are always detected automatically.

[r ] uuencoded files
[r ] files with RPM wrapper
[rw] gzip compression
[rw] bzip2 compression
[rw] compress/LZW compression
[rw] lzma, and xz compression

[r ] GNU tar format (including GNU long filenames, long link names, and
     sparse files)
[r ] Solaris 9 extended tar format (including ACLs)
[r ] Old V7 tar archives
[rw] POSIX ustar
[rw] POSIX pax interchange format
[rw] "restricted" pax format, which will create ustar archives except for
     entries that require pax extensions (for long filenames, ACLs, etc).
     This is the default, which is mostly compatible with the standard tar.
[rw] POSIX octet-oriented cpio ("odc")
[rw] SVR4 ASCII cpio ("newc")
[r ] Binary cpio (big-endian or little-endian)
[ w] shar archives
[r ] ISO9660 CD-ROM images (with optional Rockridge or Joliet extensions)
[rw] ZIP archives (with uncompressed or "deflate" compressed entries)
[rw] GNU and BSD 'ar' archives
[rw] 'mtree' format
[rw] XAR archives

DescPort: <<
Since Darwin/MacOS X does not support any tape device, the default
device is changed to stdio. The manpage warns users not to rely on
this behaviour or they knock the real tape device on other platforms.

The share/man/man5/* manpages are previously included in the
libarchive package (for developers), but now in the bsdtar package.

This package provides a legacy version of libarchive.
Packagers should link the bsdtar utility against the latest version
of the libarchive and include it into the libarchiveNN.info.
