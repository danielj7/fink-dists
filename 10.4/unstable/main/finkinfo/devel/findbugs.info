DescDetail: <<
FindBugs is a program to find bugs in Java programs.  It looks for
instances of "bug patterns" --- code instances that are likely to be
errors.

Changes since verson 0.9.6:

     * performance improvements
     * ObjectType instances are cached to reduce memory footprint
     * for performance and memory reasons stateless detectors are no
       longer cloned, must clear their own state between .class files
     * fixed bug in bytecode-set lookup for methods (was causing bad  
       results for IS2, perhaps others)
     * fix some OpcodeStack bugs with integer and long operations,  
       perform iterative analysis when effort is max
     * HTML output includes LongMessage text again (regression in  
       0.95 - 0.96)
     * New detectors
           o CalledMethods.java: builds a list of invoked methods for  
             other detectors to consult (non-reporting)
           o UncallableMethodOfAnonymousClass.java: detect anonymous  
             inner classes that define methods that are probably intended
             to but do not override methods in a superclass.
     * Updated detectors
           o FindFieldSelfAssignment.java: recognize separate fields  
             with the same name (one from superclass)
           o FindLocalSelfAssignment2.java: handles backward branches  
             better (Dave Brosius)
           o FindBadCast2.java: BC_NULL_INSTANCEOF changed to  
             NP_NULL_INSTANCEOF
           o FindPuzzlers.java: eliminate false positive on setDate()  
             (Dave Brosius)
     * Eclipse plugin
           o fix serious threading bug
           o preferences for Filters and effort (Peter Hendriks)
           o French localization (David Cotton)
           o fix bug when reporting inner classes (Peter Friese)
     * Updated test case files
           o Mwn.java (Carl Burke/Dave Brosius)
           o DumbMethodInvocations.java (Anto paul/Dave Brosius)
     * XML output includes garbage collection duration
     * French messages updated (David Cotton)
     * Swing GUI shows file name after Load Bugs command
     * Ant task to launch the findbugs frame (Mark McKay)
     * miscellaneous code cleanup

Findbugs itself is release under the LGPL, however the shell scripts that
launch the program contain some code subject to the Apache Software
License.

This is why I've set the License field to OSI-Approved
