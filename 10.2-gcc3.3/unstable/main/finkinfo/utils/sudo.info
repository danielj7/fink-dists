Description: Grant certain users/groups superuser rights
DescDetail: <<
Sudo (superuser do) allows a system administrator to give certain users (or groups of users)the
ability to run some (or all) commands as root while logging all commands and arguments.
Sudo operates on a per-command basis, it is not a replacement for the shell. 
It's features include:

	* The ability to restrict what commands a user may run on a per-host basis.

	* Sudo does copious logging of each command, providing a clear audit trail of who
did what. When used in tandem with syslogd, the system log daemon, sudo can log all 
commands to a central host (as well as on the local host). At CU, all admins use sudo in 
lieu of a root shell to take advantage of this logging.

	* Sudo uses timestamp files to implement a "ticketing" system. When a user invokes
sudo and enters their password, they are granted a ticket for 5 minutes 
(this timeout is configurable at compile-time). Each subsequent sudo command 
updates the ticket for another 5 minutes. This avoids the problem of leaving 
a root shell where others can physically get to your keyboard. There is also 
an easy way for a user to remove their ticket file, useful for placing in a .logout file.

	* Sudo's configuration file, the sudoers file, is setup in such a way that the 
same sudoers file may be used on many machines. This allows for central administration 
while keeping the flexibility to define a user's privileges on a per-host basis. 
Please see the samples sudoers file in your doc directory for a real-world example.
