Description: Graphical IRC client (with SSL)
DescDetail: <<
XChat is a graphical IRC client for UNIX operating systems (I.R.C. is Internet
Relay Chat, see http://irchelp.org for more information about IRC in general).
It runs under the X Window System and uses the GTK+2 toolkit.
<<
DescPort: <<
No -lutil is available nor required for the python plugin; thus I removed it
(and the -lpthread), which fixes the python plugin.

Perl's DynaLoader on OS X is broken, it exports two symbols (dlsym and dlclose)
which conflict with dlcompat, and break plugin support in gaim. To work around
this, we manually make these symbold static.

One more change to ltmain.sh was needed in order to convinced libtool to link
perl.so against DynaLoader.a (this seems to be a bug in libtool).
