Description: Instant Messaging client
DescDetail: <<
Gaim is a clone of AOL's Instant Messenger client. It features
nearly all of the functionality of the official AIM client while
also being smaller and faster. Gaim also has plugins that let
you use ICQ, Yahoo, MSN, IRC, Jabber, Napster, and Zephyr.
<<
DescPort: <<
Perl's DynaLoader on OS X is broken, it exports two symbols (dlsym and dlclose)
which conflict with dlcompat, and break plugin support in gaim. To work around
this, we manually make these symbold static.

Had to set the optimizations down from -O2 to -O, because of a gcc3 bug.
