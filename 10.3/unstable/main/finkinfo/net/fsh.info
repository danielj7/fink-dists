Description: Fast remote command execution
DescUsage: <<
You can use `fsh' to connect to a remote system via a tunnel.  If no
`fshd' with the approriate options is running one will be started by
`fsh'.  The exit value of `fsh' will be the exit value of the command
that is executed remotely.

Examples:
     fsh sally.lysator.liu.se echo hej
     fsh -r lsh biffen.cendio.se head -43 /etc/termcap
     fsh -l root -r lsh biffen.cendio.se head -43 /etc/termcap

   The basic invocation syntax is:
     fsh [ options ] server command args...

See the info file for more information.

DescPort: <<
The problem: logging in to a remote system with a cryptographic solution
such as lsh or ssh takes time, due to the computationally expensive key
exchanges that occur when the connection is established. It is common to
trigger a lot of remote logins while using remote CVS, which makes it
painfully slow compared to having the repository locally.

The solution: reuse the secure tunnel once it has been established. fsh
is a drop-in rsh-compatible replacement for ssh that automatically
resuses ssh tunnels.
