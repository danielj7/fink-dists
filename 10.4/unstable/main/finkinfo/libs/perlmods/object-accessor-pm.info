Description: Per-object accessor methods
DescDetail: <<
Object::Accessor provides an interface to create per object accessors
(as opposed to per Class accessors, as, for example, Class::Accessor>
provides.

You can choose to either subclass this module, and thus using its
accessors on your own module, or to store an Object::Accessor object
inside your own object, and access the accessors from there.
