Description: The eXtensible ARchiver
DescDetail: <<
xar is an archiver meant to handle the archival tasks of the 21st 
century.  It handles Extended Attributes, ACLs, Resource Forks, can
extract archives to match up the usernames/groupnames of files it
has archived (as opposed to just matching up uids/gids), and can
make you coffee.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
  The build creates two shared libs--one with install_name in %p
  the other in %b. It also creates two runtime binaries--one linked
  against each shared lib. Doesn't use libtool, so need to be able
  to test-run everything during building.

  Manually run the tests, but don't abort for the known fails.
