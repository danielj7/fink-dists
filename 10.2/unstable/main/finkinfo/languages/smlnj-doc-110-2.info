DescDetail: <<
SML/NJ is an implementation of the Standard ML programming language,
produced and maintained by researchers at Bell Labs, Princeton, Yale,
and AT&T Research.  Standard ML has many features, including type
safety, algebraic data types with pattern matching, higher-order
functions, and a sophisticated module system.  It is especially
well-suited for writing compilers and other language processors.

This package includes all the documentation from the SML/NJ web site
at Bell Labs.  It refers to version 110, the last official release.
Probably you are using a newer working version, so some of the
documentation is out of date.  It will nevertheless be useful if you
program in SML.
