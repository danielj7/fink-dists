Description: Library for client-side HTTP
DescDetail: <<
The HTTP package supports client-side web programming in Haskell. It
lets you set up HTTP connections, transmitting requests and processing
the responses coming back, all from within the comforts of
Haskell. It's dependent on the network package to operate, but other
than that, the implementation is all written in Haskell.

A basic API for issuing single HTTP requests + receiving responses is
provided. On top of that, a session-level abstraction is also on offer
(the BrowserAction monad); it taking care of handling the management
of persistent connections, proxies, state (cookies) and authentication
credentials required to handle multi-step interactions with a web
server.

The representation of the bytes flowing across is extensible via the
use of a type class, letting you pick the representation of requests
and responses that best fits your use. Some pre-packaged, common
instances are provided for you (ByteString, String.)
