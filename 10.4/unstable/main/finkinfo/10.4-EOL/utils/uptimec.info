Description: The Uptime Project 
DescDetail: <<
 The Uptime Project gathers information about registred systems 
 and presents various interesting statistics from this data. 
 Anyone can join and all that is needed is a tiny client-software
 that is installed on all hosts that participate in the project.
 The project generates lots of interesting toplists[0] and statistics[1]
 based on the data provided by the clients. 
 For more information, read the Introduction Page[2]  and 
 to get started, check out This Guide[3].

DescPort: <<
Even though ./configure does find openssl/md5.h (whether or not
openssl*-dev is installed b/c it's in /usr/include), does not find
MD5* symbols even if analogous openssl*-shlibs is, so does not use
*any* crypto. Hence no need for any deps on any openssl* pkgs at all.
