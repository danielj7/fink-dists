DescDetail: <<
CD-HI/CD-HIT clusters protein sequence database at high sequence identity 
threshold. This program can remove the high sequence redundance efficiently.

cd-hit groups proteins into clusters that meet a user-defined similarity 
threshold. cd-hit-est is similar to cd-hit, but designed to group nucleotide 
sequences (without introns). cd-hit-est-2d is similar to cd-hit-2d but 
designed to compare two nucleotide datasets.
