Description: Perl module for writing XML documents
DescDetail: <<
  XML::Writer is a simple Perl module for writing XML documents: it
  takes care of constructing markup and escaping data correctly, and by
  default, it also performs a significant amount of well-formedness
  checking on the output, to make certain (for example) that start and
  end tags match, that there is exactly one document element, and that
  there are not duplicate attribute names.
