DescDetail: <<
	A version of gnutar for Mac OS X that supports archiving HFS+
	specific information such as resource forks, type and creator
	codes as well as other finder flags.
<<
DescPort: Adjusted infodir and libexecdir to conform with Fink standards.
DescPackaging: <<
	- The executable is renamed via --program-transform-name to
	  avoid conflict with standard tar.
	- Hack alert: --program-transform-name is not fully
	  implemented throughout the included Makefiles, so PACKAGE
	  name in configure is also patched. This renames the mo
	  locale files, and adjusts the binary source to look in the
	  correct --default-domain path for the renamed mo files.
	- Manually renamed infodoc file to match.
    - Patched test because fink's xgettext can't handle non-ASCII.
