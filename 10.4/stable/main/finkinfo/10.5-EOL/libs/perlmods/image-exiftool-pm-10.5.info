Package: image-exiftool-pm
Version: 8.90
Revision: 1
Description: Read and write image/movie meta information
# as of 9.01 release, requires Digest::SHA, which is varianted
# and is also in perl core as of 5.9.3. Messy to have non-varianted
# package on 10.5 (system perl 5.8.8) with varianted dependency,
# so not bothering to upgrade there unless someone really wants it.
