DescDetail: <<
Freeciv is a Free and Open Source empire-building strategy game 
     inspired by the history of human civilization. The game 
     commences in prehistory and your mission is to lead your tribe 
     from the stone age to the space age...
<<
DescUsage: <<
To start freeciv:
   - Open XTerm or a similar terminal window inside an X environment
     and at the command prompt type 'freeciv-gtk2' to start the
     client.
   - The game window will come up giving you the option to join a
     server 'Connect to Network Game'. For a local game, select 
     'Start New Game', 'Start Scenario Game', or 'Load Saved Game' 
     as desired.  The server will start automagically if needed.
   - The auxiliary program 'civmanual' creates html versions of the
     rules.  It will silently fail if it doesn't have permission to
     write the files, so either invoke from a directory that is
     writeable by all, or invoke as a superuser.
