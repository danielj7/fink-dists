Description: Common Scalar and List utility subroutines
DescDetail: <<
  This package contains a selection of subroutines that people have
  expressed would be nice to have in the perl core, but the usage would not
  really be high enough to warrant the use of a keyword, and the size so
  small such that being individual extensions would be wasteful.
