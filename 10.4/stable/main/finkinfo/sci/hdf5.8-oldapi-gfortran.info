DescDetail:  <<
HDF5 was designed to address some of the limitations of the HDF 4.x library
and to address current and anticipated requirements of modern systems
and applications. 

The fortran9X interface is built using gfortran.
It will only work with gfortran.

Fink's "%N*" packages are intended to replace the corresponding ones from
"hdf5-18*".  
<<
DescUsage: <<
To build against %N instead of hdf5.8-gfortran, you will need 
to make sure that the headers in %p/opt/hdf5v1.6/include 
and the libraries in %p/opt/hdf5v1.6/lib are found.  
Some packages use a configure flag to target the hdf5 tree, i.e.:
--with-hdf5=%p/opt, but you may need to set CPPFLAGS, LDFLAGS, etc. 
for your package.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
	Built separately from the rest of hdf5.8-oldapi so that people who don't need the FORTRAN libs 
	don't have to build gcc4N.

	No BuildDepends on hdf5.8-oldapi because we build _all_ of HDF5 and then strip out the C and 
	C++ libs, as well as anything that is also in the hdf5.8-oldapi package.

	Buildepends on fink (>= 0.34.8) since that's when we introduced a clang compiler
	wrapper.
<<
DescPort: <<
	Manually generate appropriate system configuration files to be found by the configure script.
