Description: Array-based data access, Fortran headers/doc
DescDetail: <<
The netCDF (network Common Data Form) library defines a machine-independent
format for representing scientific data. Together, the interface, library,
and format support the creation, access, and sharing of scientific data.

This package provides a library, documentation, and examples for interfacing
with Fortran 77 and Fortran 90 code using the gfortran compiler.  Because the
library links to libraries from gcc4N-shlibs, a particular gcc4N had to be 
chosen.
<<
DescUsage: <<
When building by hand against this package, make sure netcdf-c7 is installed,
since, by policy, this package cannot declare a runtime dependency on it.

It does, however, have a dependency on gcc5-compiler, since that's legit.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
Whoops, this should have been "netcdf-fortran_6_"  Meh.

Manually move docs from the tarball to avoid potentially triggering a rebuild.

Bump revision and versioned dependencies on hdf5.X and netcdf-c7 when HDF5 (hdf5.X) 
version is updated.

Specify full path to the "gfortran" executable in gcc4N compiler to avoid 
extra double-underscores.  (Thanks, libtool!)

BuildConflict on versions of the BDO package which are built with earlier gfortran
than we are to keep the build from picking up a %p/include/netcdf.mod which was built
with the wrong gfortran:

/sw/lib/gcc5/bin/gfortran -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -I. -I.. -I../libsrc   -I/sw/include -I../fortran   -I../fortran -O2 -c -o ftst_path.o ftst_path.F
ftst_path.F:82:11:

        use netcdf
          1
Fatal Error: Cannot read module file 'netcdf.mod' opened at (1), because it was created by a different version of GNU Fortran
compilation terminated.  


Parallel tests give an error:

/sw/lib/gcc5/bin/gfortran -I../fortran   -I../fortran -O2 -c -o f90tst_parallel.o  f90tst_parallel.f90
f90tst_parallel.f90:44: Error: Can't open included file 'mpif.h'

so we turn them off.

DescPort: <<
FFLAGS=-O2 FCFLAGS=-O2 is essential to avoid debugging mode flags (-g).
