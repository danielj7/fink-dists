DescDetail: <<
spim is a self-contained simulator that will run MIPS32 assembly language
programs. It reads and executes assembly language programs written for this
processor. spim also provides a simple debugger and minimal set of operating
system services. spim does not execute binary (compiled) programs.

spim implements almost the entire MIPS32 assembler-extended instruction set.
(It omits most floating point comparisons and rounding modes and the memory
system page tables.) The MIPS architecture has several variants that differ in
various ways (e.g., the MIPS64 architecture supports 64-bit integers and
addresses), which means that spim will not run programs compiled for all types
of MIPS processors. MIPS compilers also generate a number of assembler
directives that spim cannot process. These directives usually can be safely
deleted.

Earlier versions of spim (before 7.0) implemented the MIPS-I instruction set
used on the MIPS R2000/R3000 computers. This architecture is obsolete (though,
has never been surpassed for its simplicity and elegance). spim now supports
the more modern MIPS32 architecture, which is the MIPS-I instruction set
augmented with a large number of occasionally useful instructions. MIPS code
from earlier versions of SPIM should run without changes, except code that
handles exceptions and interrupts. This part of the architecture changed over
time (and was poorly implemented in earlier versions of spim). Code of this
sort need to be updated. Examples of the new code are in
%p/lib/spim/exceptions.s and
%p/share/spim/Tests/tt.io.s.

spim implements both a simple, terminal-style interface and a window interface.
The spim program provides a simple terminal interface and the xspim program
provides the windowing interface.

DescPackaging: <<
In order to get rid of xmkmf/imake, the patch script was actually based on the
Makefile from ../spim (the console version), adding the appropriate
X11 header/library flags.
