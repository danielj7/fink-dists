Description: Perl module to access the unix process table
DescDetail: <<
This module is a first crack at providing a consistent interface to
Unix (and maybe other multitasking OS's) process table information.
The impetus for this came about with my frustration at having to parse
the output of various systems' ps commands to check whether specific
processes were running on different boxes at a larged mixed Unix site.
The output format of ps was different on each OS, and sometimes
changed with each new release of an OS. Also, running a ps subprocess
from within a perl or shell script and parsing the output was not a
very efficient or aesthetic way to do things.
<<
DescUsage: <<
With this module, you can do things like this:

        # kill memory pigs 
        use Proc::ProcessTable;

        $t = new Proc::ProcessTable;
        foreach $p ( @{$t->table} ){    
          if( $p->pctmem > 95 ){
            $p->kill(9);
          }             
        }

There is another short example in the file "example.pl" in the
distribution. For a more elaborate example (in German), see
<http://www.linux-magazin.de/ausgabe.1999.02/Proc/proc.html>.
<shameless plug> If you can't read German, try my other module,
WWW::Babelfish!</shameless plug> 
        
There are also two contributed modules: a module called Proc::Killall
contributed by Aaron Sherman to kill all processes whose command-lines
match a given pattern, and a module called Proc::Killfam by Stephen
Lidie to kill a list of processes and their children. These modules
are installed along with Proc::ProcessTable. Pod documentation is
included in both of them.

DescPackaging: <<
CPAN 0.39 tarball accidentally dropped darwin files, so using CVS
snapshot (that also includes some other useful patches).

OS X 10.3 changed ps but Proc::ProcessTable CVS hasn't added the
needed changes. The updated files are attached to a SF tracker item:
  http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=902245&group_id=81217&atid=562307
so we'll just download (a mirror of) that file and overlay the files.
