DescDetail: <<
Boost provides free peer-reviewed portable C++ source libraries.
A large part of Boost is provided as C++ template code which is
resolved entirely at compile-time without linking. This package
aims to provide the most useful subset of Boost libraries for
template use among CRAN package. By placing these libraries in
this package, we offer a more efficient distribution system for
CRAN as replication of this code in the sources of other
packages is avoided.
