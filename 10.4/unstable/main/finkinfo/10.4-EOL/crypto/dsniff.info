Description: Network auditing and penetration test tools
DescDetail: <<
dsniff is a collection of tools for network auditing and penetration 
testing. dsniff, filesnarf, mailsnarf, msgsnarf, urlsnarf, and
webspy passively monitor a network for interesting data (passwords,
e-mail, files, etc.). arpspoof, dnsspoof, and macof facilitate the
interception of network traffic normally unavailable to an attacker
(e.g, due to layer-2 switching). sshmitm and webmitm implement
active monkey-in-the-middle attacks against redirected SSH and HTTPS 
sessions by exploiting weak bindings in ad-hoc PKI.

DescPackaging: <<
dmacks: Appears to need substantial patching to be buildable with libnet1.1
        Should keep libnet1.x version in sync with libnids
