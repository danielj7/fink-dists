DescDetail: <<
abc is a way to notate tunes in ascii.  It can be translated to and from sheet
music or MIDI, and read by humans with a bit of practice. For more information
on it, please see: http://abc.sourceforge.net

abcm2ps creates nicely laid-out PostScript files from abc tunes.  The m stands
for "many", since abcm2ps is an extension of another program, abc2ps, adding
support for many voices per staff.
