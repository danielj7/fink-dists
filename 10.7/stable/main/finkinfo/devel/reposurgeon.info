# DISCLAIMER: Max Horn is the sole maintainer of this package.
# Please DO NOT MAKE MODIFICATIONS without informing the maintainer.
# Preferably, send a patch to me instead of making changes yourself!
# If that is not possible due to extra urgency, at least send me a mail.
#
# Explanation: I am sick and tired of getting back to my packages and
# discovering that people have messed with it. I am then forced to
# retrace their steps, find out who, when and why did make a certain
# change etc. -- i.e. it makes my life as maintainer harder.
# Furthermore, as maintainer I am responsible for problems caused by my
# packages. But I am not willing to take responsibility for something I
# did not do. In particular, for changes that other people introduced
# behind my back, no matter how good and noble their intentions were. As
# such, I may see myself forced to drop responsibility for (and hence,
# maintainership of) the affected package.

Description: Tool for editing version-control repositories
DescDetail: <<
reposurgeon enables risky operations that version-control systems don't
want to let you do, such as editing past comments and metadata and
removing commits. It works with any version control system that can
export and import git fast-import streams, including git and hg and bzr.
It can also read Subversion dump files directly and can thus be used to
script production of very high-quality conversions from Subversion to
any supported DVCS.
