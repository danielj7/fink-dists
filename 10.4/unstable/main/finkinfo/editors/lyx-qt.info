Description: Wordprocessor utilizing LaTeX (QT version)
DescDetail: <<
LyX is a modern approach of writing documents with a computer
which breaks with the tradition of the obsolete typewriter
concept.  It is designed for people who want a professional
output with a minimum of time and effort, without becoming specia-
lists in typesetting.  Compared to common word processors LyX
will increase the productivity a lot, since most of the type-
setting will be done by the computer, not the author.  With LyX
the author can concentrate on the contents of his writing,
since the computer will take care of the look.

This version uses the QT GUI toolkit (instead of xforms).
<<
DescUsage: <<
If you're using a non-Fink TeX distro, you'll want to run

/path/to/mktexlsr %p/etc/texmf.local
after installation of the package, and also after removing it, 
to integrate its style and class files with your TeX setup.

DescPort: <<
Thanks to Ronald Florence for his instructions on getting
lyx-1.3.2 to compile (http://www.18james.com/lyx_on_osx.html)
lyx is a wrapper script that sets up symlinks to latex-xft fonts
fonts in ~/.fonts, so that lyx-qt will find them.
Patch to prevent BusError when new file is opened with keyboard
shortcut.
Some bits are compiled without optimization to work around 
problems with g++-3.3 on ppc.
<<
DescPackaging:  <<
We've gotten rid of an explicit TeX dependency.
