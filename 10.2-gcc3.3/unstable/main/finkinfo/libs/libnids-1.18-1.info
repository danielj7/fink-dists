DescDetail: <<
 Libnids is a library that provides a functionality of one of NIDS 
 (Network Intrusion Detection System) components, namely E-component. It means 
 that libnids code watches all local network traffic, cooks received datagrams 
 a bit (quite a bit ;)), and provides convenient information on them to 
 analyzing modules of NIDS. Libnids performs:
 a) assembly of TCP segments into TCP streams
 b) IP defragmentation
 c) TCP port scan detection 
 More technical info can be found in MISC file.
 So, if you intend to develop a custom NIDS, you don't have to build
 low-level network code. If you decide to use libnids, you have got
 E-component ready - you can focus on implementing other parts of NIDS.
