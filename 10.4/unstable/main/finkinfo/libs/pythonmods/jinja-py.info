Description: Python template engine
DescDetail: <<
Jinja is a library for Python 2.4 and onwards that is designed to be
flexible, fast and secure. If you have any exposure to other
text-based template languages, such as Smarty or Django, you should
feel right at home with Jinja. It's both designer and developer
friendly by sticking to Python's principles and adding functionality
useful for templating environments.
