Description: Flight Planning Tool
DescDetail: <<
 xfplan is an application designed to assist general aviation pilots in 
 creating flight plans for cross country flights in powered aircraft.
<<

DescUsage: <<
 xfplan requires a database of airports, VORs, etc to do anything useful.
 You can download the latest database of US airports, navaids and state 
 boundaries at  http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=137000.  
 Look for the file "fplan-db". The database should be expanded and the files 
 copied to %p/share/fplan
 
 Use paddb to create a personal database if desired.  paddb is very 
 particular about the format of the input file.  See the User's Quide and
 man 5 fplan.
 
 This package will not build with gcc 4.0.  It requires gcc 3.3.  Issue a 
 "gcc_select 3.3" in the Terminal to switch to gcc 4.0 if required.
 
 Many features do not yet work, including saving files.  Development progress
 is very slow.  It isn't obvious when or if new features will be added.  Basic
 flight planning does work.
