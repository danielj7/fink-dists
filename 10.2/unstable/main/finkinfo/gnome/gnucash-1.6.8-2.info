Description: Personal finance tracking program.
DescDetail: <<
Gnucash can track finances in multiple accounts, keeping running
and reconciled balances. It has an X based graphical user interface,
double entry, a hierarchy of accounts, expense accounts (categories),
and can import Quicken QIF files.
Gnucash is derived from xacc.  It adds guile extensibility, and can
produce HTML output.  It uses guppi to produce graphs.

DescPort: << 
Version 1.6.4:
Patches to include sys/types.h before dirent.h
Adds localtime_r and strptime ( also adds scm_strptime to guile )
Works around a scanf bug which fails with spaces before %n
configure and automake changes to support the above.
Doesn't work on OS10.0.x because of missing %qd support, if you really
need it to work on these systems contact me about it.
Version 1.6.5:           
Old patch applied okay. Changed all setlocale(LC_MESSAGES,NULL) to
getenv("LANG"), so that i18n has a chance to work.
Added some checks for Darwin Bug #2752682 where setlocale can return NULL.
Patched some files to actually check for error after fopen.
The scanf bug is fixed in darwin sources (Thanks Apple!).
Version 1.6.6:
Minor changes in upstream, new translations, some bug fixes.
Version 1.6.6-3:
Compiles with gcc3, builds a little faster.
Version 1.6.6-4:
Updated to use guppi16 as a depends.
Version 1.6.6-5:
Removed troublesome locale.alias file.
Version 1.6.8-1:
Old patch applied mostly okay, needed to change SetLDFlags to SetLibs to stop
it from linking against installed library.

At present, since there are neither headers nor public API for the shared
library, the dylib file is being left in the main package rather than being
split off into a gnucash-shlibs package.
