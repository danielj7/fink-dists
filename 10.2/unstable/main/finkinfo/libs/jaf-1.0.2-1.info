Description: JavaBeans Activation Framework
DescDetail: <<
With the JavaBeans Activation Framework standard extension, developers who use
Java technology can take advantage of standard services to determine the type of
an arbitrary piece of data, encapsulate access to it, discover the operations
available on it, and to instantiate the appropriate bean to perform said
operation(s).  For example, if a browser obtained a JPEG image, this framework
would enable the browser to identify that stream of data as an JPEG image, and
from that type, the browser could locate and instantiate an object that could
manipulate, or view that image.
