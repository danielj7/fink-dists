Description: Instant flyaway information note taker
DescDetail: <<
Comment is a command line directory context note taker. Notes are stored 
in both the local directory and each users home. It was developed as a 
low impact tool for retaining flyaway information that is often needed at 
a later date. The dual storage system provides convenient access to prior 
notes, and all notes are stored in plain-text format.
