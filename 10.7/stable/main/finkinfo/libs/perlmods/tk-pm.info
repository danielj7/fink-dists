Description: Graphical User Interface ToolKit
DescDetail: <<
  Graphical User Interface ToolKit
<<
DescPort: <<
  (monipol) -pm586 on 10.5 gives bus error, so disable it.

  Had to disable 'make test' since it requires X11 to be running and with
  fink there is no real way to verify or enforce this behavior.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
  Several different pkg layouts used in past, so need extra Replaces
  in the SplitOffs.

  There was an invalid %v string (containing underscore) in the
  804.025 series; Conflicts/Replaces were raised slightly to we don't
  have to refer to a broken value.

  804.026-13 moved share/man/man1 from -man to -bin, so -bin has to
  conflict with earlier revisions.

  -14 moved manpages out of share/ for the first time. Now no longer
  need to worry about prior -man vs. -bin conflicts since the files
  never existed in the new location in any old version.

	Fix canonical #! perl interp in demos/widget so makemaker will
	automaticlly replace with proper one

	Patch MakeDepend.pm to allow runtime env var to take
	precedence (prepend to) value used when building perl itself.
	
  -201(10.7) is building internal libjpeg and libpng.  Still trying
  to have it use system libraries, but now works on 10.7.
