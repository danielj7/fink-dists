+.SH NAME
+xttitle \- change X terminal emulator window titles
+
+.SH SYNOPSIS
+.B xttitle
+.RI title
+[ icon ]
+
+.SH DESCRIPTION
+This manual page documents briefly the
+.B xttitle
+command.
+This manual page was written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution
+because the original program does not have a manual page.
+
+.PP
+.\" TeX users may be more comfortable with the \fB<whatever>\fP and
+.\" \fI<whatever>\fP escape sequences to invode bold face and italics,
+.\" respectively.
+\fBxttitle\fP is a program that changes the title (and possibly icon) of your
+X terminal emulator windows. It should work for any program that emulates an
+xterm-like terminal under X.
+
+.PP
+You may want to create an alias in your shell for 'cd', so that your window
+title keeps track of your current working directory. In Bash, the following
+seems to work for me:
+
+.nf
+	update_title()
+	{
+		[ $TERM = 'xterm ] && xttitle "[$$] ${USER}@${HOSTNAME}:$PWD"
+	}
+
+	function cd()
+	{
+		builtin cd $*; update_title
+ 	}
+.fi
+
+You can then set up other things that run update_title - for instance you may
+want to put it in your shell startup file so that the title gets updated when
+you open a new terminal emulator window.
