Description: GNU flavoured basic commands
DescDetail: <<
The GNU Core Utilities are the basic file, shell and text manipulation
utilities of the GNU operating system.  These are the core utilities
which are expected to exist on every operating system.

Previously these utilities were offered as three individual sets of
GNU utilities, fileutils, shellutils, and textutils. Those three have
been combined into a single set of utilities called the coreutils.

The commands are named with 'g' prefix like 'gls' or 'gcp'. If you want
to use them as 'ls' or 'cp', add %p/lib/coreutils/bin to your PATH
or install the coreutils-default package.

As the exception, the 'rm' command is named as 'rm.gnu' instead of 'grm'
because the cwp-su package has another 'grm'.
<<
DescUsage: <<
The exotic commands like mknod may or may not work in a useful manner
on Darwin. Following commands are removed due to their breakage:
- su
- users
- who
<<
DescPort: <<
charset.alias is deleted because it is empty on Darwin anyway and
causes unnecessary conflicts between packages.

About the jm_cv_func_svid_putenv=yes, see:
http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-gnulib/2007-10/msg00514.html

Since the ACL support in 10.5 looks buggy and breaks make check,
I turned off it.  I can't tell whether MacOS or coreutils is wrong.

AKH:  made running the test suite optional.

  DescDetail: << 
The GNU Core Utilities are the basic file, shell and text manipulation
utilities of the GNU operating system.  These are the core utilities
which are expected to exist on every operating system.

This package serves the commands without 'g' prefix like 'ls' or 'cp'.
  <<
  DescPort: <<
Symlinks to md5sum, readlink and mktemp is not created, it is already
contained in the essential packages.

Symlink to tsort (topological sort) is not created because it breaks
other packages. The GNU version of tsort doesn't output files that are
part of a cycle, while the BSD tsort that ships with Darwin does.

Symlink to base64 is not created because it conflicts against
the base64 package.
