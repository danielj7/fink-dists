DescDetail: <<
The package allows one to compose general HTTP requests and provides
convenient functions to fetch URIs, get & post forms, etc. and process
the results returned by the Web server. This provides a great deal of
control over the HTTP/FTP/... connection and the form of the request 
while providing a higher-level interface than is available just using
R socket connections. Additionally, the underlying implementation is
robust and extensive, supporting FTP/FTPS/TFTP (uploads and downloads),
SSL/HTTPS, telnet, dict, ldap, and also supports cookies, redirects,
authentication, etc.
