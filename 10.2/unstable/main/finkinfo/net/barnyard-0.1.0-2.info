Description: Output spool reader for Snort
DescDetail: << 
This program decouples output overhead from the Snort network intrusion 
detection system and allows Snort to run at full speed.

It is controlled by two main types of directives:
Input processors and output plugins.  The input processors read
information in from a specific format ( currently the spo_unified
output module of Snort ) and output them in one of several ways.

Barnyard allows Snort to write to disk in an efficient manner and
leaves the task of parsing binary data into various formats to a
separate process that will not cause Snort to miss network traffic.
