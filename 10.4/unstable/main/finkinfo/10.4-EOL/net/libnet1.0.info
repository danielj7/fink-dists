Description: Set of routines to handle network packets
DescPackaging: <<
Patched to build correctly on Intel and use libtool in Makefile
to build shared libraries. We use the libtool -release flag
since upstream interface plans are unknown and probably moot
since there doesn't seem to BE an upstream anymore.

I'm not sure why libnet-config is being installed in etc,
but I left it there since something might use it. I did
remove the ConfFiles field since that caused libnet-config
to stick around even after package removal. Yikes!
