DescDetail:<<
Maxima is a descendant of the symbol manipulation program Macsyma, 
which had its roots in the late 1960s at MIT. Its abilities include 
basic algebraic manipulation, symbolic integration, 2D and 3D plotting, 
and an ODE solver.

DescUsage:<<
If you have trouble installing with Fink Commander, try installing from
the command line (and don't divert the output to a file).

Enter "maxima" to get a command line interface. The script "xmaxima"
provides a graphical interface using the tcltk wish shell. To take
advantage of this, either install tcltk using fink (for an X-windows
interface) or from Apple's downloads page (for an aqua interface). If
you have both versions of tcltk installed, you may need to edit the
opening lines of /sw/bin/xmaxima to point to the correct wish.
