Description: Pipe utility to treat backticks as filenames
DescDetail: <<
The ypipe utility is used to create systems of pipes and fifos (named
pipes) more complicated than standard shell syntax allows. A single
invocation of ypipe has the following effect: a temporary fifo is
created; the name of this fifo is printed on standard output; and
ypipe exits, leaving a child process in the background to copy any
data received on standard input to the fifo. The net effect of this is
that you can use the expression `subcommand | ypipe` anywhere on a
command line that you would use a filename, and the output of
subcommand will be piped appropriately to create the illusion that
`subcommand | ypipe` is a file, containing the output of subcommand.

DescPort: <<
Installing as "ypipe" instead of "y" so as not to be confused with
something related to the "y" character-map operator of perl and sed.
Error messages changed accordingly.
