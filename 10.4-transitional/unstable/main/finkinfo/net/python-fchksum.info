Description: Python extension to find checksum of files
DescDetail: <<
fchksum is a Python module to find the checksum of files. Currently 
it supports md5, crc32, cksum, bsd-style sum, and sysv-style sum.

The advantage of using fchksum over the python md5 and zlib(.crc32) 
modules is both ease of use and speed. You only need to tell it the 
filename and the actual work is done by C code. Compared to the implementing 
a read loop in python with the standard python modules, fchksum is up to 2.0x 
faster in md5 and 1.1x faster in crc32. fchksum is written in C, and should 
probably compile on any unix. Most likely on other operating systems too.
