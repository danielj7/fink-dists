This Python extension contains a BibTeX parser and a simple binding to
the GNU Recode library. They are intended to be used with
Pybliographer.
<<
DescUsage: <<
As of version 1.2.4, the package became varianted packages named
python-bibtex-pyXX for individual pythonX.X versions. The old
python-bibtex, which was implicitly for python2.5 was thus a dummy
upgrader to the new python-bibtex-py25.

Now updated to the py26 variant as upstream python25 is EOL'ed.
