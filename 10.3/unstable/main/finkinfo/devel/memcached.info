Description: High-performance object caching system
DescDetail: <<
 Memcached is a distributed memory object caching system, 
 intended for use in speeding up dynamic web applications. 
 Client modules exist for PHP, Ruby, Perl, Java, C and C sharp
<<
DescUsage: <<
 to start the server just type:
 memcached -d -m 2048 -l 10.0.0.40 -p 11211
 
 This starts memcached up as a daemon, using 2GB of memory, 
 and listening on IP 10.0.0.40, port 11211. 
 Because a 32-bit process can only address 4GB of virtual 
 memory (usually significantly less, depending on your operating system), 
 if you have a 32-bit server with 4-64GB of memory using PAE you can just 
 run multiple processes on the machine, each using 2 or 3GB of memory.
