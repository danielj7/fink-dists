Description: Graphical network monitor
DescDetail: <<
EtherApe is a graphical network monitor for Unix modeled after
etherman. Featuring link layer, ip and TCP modes, it displays 
network activity graphically. Hosts and links change in size 
with traffic. Color coded protocols display. It supports 
Ethernet, FDDI, Token Ring, ISDN, PPP and SLIP devices. It can
filter traffic to be shown, and can read traffic from a file 
as well as live from the network.
