Description: GNU Internationalization utils

DescDetail: <<
  The gettext packages provides some of the i18n and l10n support used by
  many GNU programs but missing from the Darwin C library.
<<

DescPort: <<
  charset.alias is deleted because it is empty on Darwin anyway and
  causes unnecessary conflicts between packages.

  The emacs files have been moved to a separate gettext-emacs package
  (EMACS=no prevents them from being compiled here).
<<
DescPackaging: <<
  We now follow the packaging advice from the upstream authors, and have
  separated gettext-tools into its own package (a separate build from
  the same source).  The libraries from that portion have gone into
  libgettextpo2-*.

  However, we have retained the idea of a gettext-doc splitoff from
  the previous version of libgettext3-shlibs, which was prepared by
  Chris Zubrzycki.

  The two shared libraries libgettextlib-%v.dylib and libgettextsrc-%v.dylib
  are intended to only be used by binaries in the gettext-tools package
  (to avoid duplication of code in those binaries, apparently). They
  are thus private shared libraries in the package with the binaries.
  The files used to link against them are removed so that nothing else
  can link to those libraries.

  We also remove a few stray files related to libintl which 'make install'
  installs for us.
