DescDetail: <<
This package provides a high-level R interface to data files written
using Unidata's netCDF library (version 4 or earlier), which are
binary data files that are portable across platforms and include
metadata information in addition to the data sets. Using this package,
netCDF files (either version 4 or "classic" version 3) can be opened
and data sets read in easily. It is also easy to create new netCDF
dimensions, variables, and files, in either version 3 or 4 format,
and manipulate existing netCDF files. This package replaces the
former ncdf package, which only worked with netcdf version 3 files.
For various reasons the names of the functions have had to be
changed from the names in the ncdf package. The old ncdf package
is still available at the URL given below, if you need to have
backward compatibility. It should be possible to have both the
ncdf and ncdf4 packages installed simultaneously without a problem.
However, the ncdf package does not provide an interface for netcdf
version 4 files.
