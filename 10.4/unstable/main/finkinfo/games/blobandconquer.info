Description: 3D Platform shooting game
DescDetail: <<
	Blob Wars episode II: Blob and Conquer is the sequel to Blob Wars:
	Metal Blob Solid. 
	 With the apparent defeat of Galdov and the reclaiming of the Fire, Time,
	Space and Reality Crystals the Blobs' battle was only just beginning. Bob
	had rescued many Blobs and fought many battles, but now he had an ever
	bigger task ahead of him. The Blobs' homeworld is still littered with the alien
	forces and Bob once again makes it his task to lead the counter attack. But
	even without Galdov the aliens are still extremely well organised...
