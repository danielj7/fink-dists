DescDetail: <<
Oneko is a little X application that puts a kitty on the screen
that follows your mouse cursor around.  Oneko can not only have a kitty
follow your cursor around, but also a tiger, a dog, and a bsd daemon.
<<
DescPort: <<
Oneko will only follow your cursor if X11 is in the foreground.  Effectively,
Oneko only exists in X display space, so it doesn't recognize you when you
are outside of X space.
