Description: Circuit drawing app with schematic capture
DescDetail: <<
XCircuit is a UNIX/X11 (and now Windows, if you have an X-Server running) 
program for drawing publishable-quality electrical circuit schematic diagrams 
and related figures, and produce circuit netlists through schematic capture. 
XCircuit regards circuits as inherently hierarchical, and writes both 
hierarchical PostScript output and hierarchical SPICE netlists. 
Circuit components are saved in and retrieved from libraries which are fully 
editable. XCircuit does not separate artistic expression from circuit drawing; 
it maintains flexiblity in style without compromising the power of schematic 
capture.

XCircuit is flexible enough to be used as a generic program for drawing just 
about anything, and is competitive with powerful programs such as "xfig". 
It is especially good for any task requiring repeated use of a standard set of 
graphical objects, including architectural drawing, printed circuit board 
layouts, and (my personal favorite) music typography.

This package represents the upstream "Development" branch.
<<
DescUsage: <<
 Depending on your X11 environment, dialog boxes can get buried
behind the main window.
<<
DescPort: <<
Needed to add -fno-common to CFLAGS.
Added -I/usr/X11R6/include to CFLAGS because it wouldn't work with 
CPPFLAGS.  This is needed because the linker apparently can't find
the X11 headers by default on XFree86 or Xorg.
Patch Makefile.am to make sure that xcircuit.dylib has a proper 
install_name.

Move manpage to Fink-compliant location in the InstallScript.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
Now requires automake1.9 to build
3.6.78-1 and later:  includes Python bindings (they come with the tarball) and
examples.  App-defaults file is installed in a Fink-compliant location.
