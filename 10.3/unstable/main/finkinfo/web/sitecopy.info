Description: Web site uploader
DescDetail: <<
sitecopy keeps your web site in sync with a local directory. It
uploads new or changed files and delete obsolete file from the
server. It supports FTP and WebDAV.

This package doesn't build SSL support, use sitecopy-ssl instead if
you need it.
<<
DescPort: <<
Uses autoconf, but custom Makefiles. Not all Makefiles
use CPPFLAGS, so we put the include path in CFLAGS, too.

dmacks: move builddir -I flags ahead of systemwide ones
