Description: Fast lexical analyser generator (development version)
DescDetail: <<
Flex is a tool for generating programs that require pattern-matching
on text. It is usually used together with yacc/bison to automatically
generate a parser for a language grammar, e.g. the syntax of a
configuration file.

This is a version of Flex that generates better C++ code than the
standard 2.5.4 Flex, but also has some compatibility problems with
the older flex as well, so it installs into %p/lib/flex and must
be explicitly linked by projects that want to use it.
<<
DescUsage: <<
You will need to explicitly add the paths to this version of flex
to your environment to use it (so that it doesn't get in the way of
the "regular" flex).

Generally you should be able to do it by doing something like:

  export PATH="%p/lib/flex/bin:$PATH"
  export CPPFLAGS="-I%p/lib/flex/include"
  export LDFLAGS="-L%p/lib/flex/lib"
