Description: Web site uploader (with SSL)
DescDetail: <<
sitecopy keeps your web site in sync with a local directory. It
uploads new or changed files and delete obsolete file from the
server. It supports FTP and WebDAV.

This package builds SSL support, use sitecopy instead if
you don't need it. 
<<
DescPort: <<
Uses autoconf, but custom Makefiles. Not all Makefiles
use CPPFLAGS, so we put the include path in CFLAGS, too.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
 Although this package has a GPL license, it is marked Restrictive since
 it links to openssl.
