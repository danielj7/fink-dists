Description: LaTeX-oriented text editor
DescDetail: <<
 ROBODoc is a API documentation tool for C, C++, Java, Assembler, 
 Basic, Fortran, LaTeX, Postscript, Tcl/Tk, LISP, Forth, Perl, 
 Shell Scripts, Makefiles, Occam, COBOL, DCL, Visual Basic, HTML, 
 DB/C, XML, and many other languages. It can be made to work with 
 any language that supports comments.
 Usage
 * First read the doc at %p/share/doc/robodoc/
 * The rtf format created works with AbiWord, just import the 
   file created by robodoc and create a table of contents with
   Abiword. It also works probably with OpenOffice, but not 
   with TextEdit, unless saved beforehand with AbiWord.
 * For generating pdf document from DocBook xml files, use xsltproc
   with the fo xslt stylesheet and fop:
   xsltproc --output api.fo pathtofo/docbook.xsl api.xml
   fop -fo api.fo -pdf api.pdf
   You may have to customize the stylesheet to get right toc numbering.
 * For generating html document from DocBook xml files, just give the
   right path to docbook.xsl:
   xsltproc --output api.html pathtohtml/docbook.xsl api.xml
 * Other formats from %p/share/doc/robodoc/Examples work right out of the box.
 * Apart the binaries robodoc and robohdrs in %p/bin, there are two files
   in %p/share/doc/%N/Contributions: robodoc.kaptn to create robodoc.rc 
   file with Kaptain; and robodoc2pod.pl to create perldoc.
 * You may have to install tetex and the desired dvi, ps, pdf viewers,
   Docbook bundle, and eventually Kaptain.
