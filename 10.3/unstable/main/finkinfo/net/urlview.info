DescDetail: <<
 This utility is used to extract URL from text files, especially from
 mail messages in order to launch some browser to view them. This used
 to be a part of mutt but has now become an independent tool
<<
DescUsage: <<
 It compiles and runs fine, but requires additional customization to
 call your preferred browser. See the docs and modify the url_handler.sh
 script as necessary (at least until the package is update with sensible
 defaults...).
