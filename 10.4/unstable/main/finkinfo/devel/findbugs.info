DescDetail: <<
FindBugs is a program to find bugs in Java programs.  It looks for
instances of "bug patterns" --- code instances that are likely to be
errors.

Changes since version 1.2.0

 * Bug fixes:
   - Fix bugs in incremental analysis within Eclipse plugin
   - Fix some analysis errors
   - Fix some threading bugs in GUI2
   - Report version as version when it was compiled, not when it was run
   - Copy analysis time stamp when filtering or transforming analysis files.

 * Enabled StaticCalendarDetector

 * Reworked GUI2 to use standard FindBugs filters

 * Allow a suppression filter to be stored in a project and persisted
   to the XML representation of a project.

 * Move away from old GUI2 save format (a directory containing an xml
   file and another file containing serialized filters).

 * Supprt/recommend use of two new file extensions/formats:

    .fba - FindBugs Analysis File
           Exactly the same as an existing bug collection file stored
           in XML format, but using a distinct file extension to make
           it easier to figure out which xml files contain FindBugs
           results.

    .fbp - FindBugs Project File
           Contains just the information needed to run FindBugs and
           display the results (e.g., the files to be analyzed, the
           auxilary class path and the location of source files)

Findbugs itself is release under the LGPL, however the shell scripts that
launch the program contain some code subject to the Apache Software
License.

This is why I've set the License field to OSI-Approved
