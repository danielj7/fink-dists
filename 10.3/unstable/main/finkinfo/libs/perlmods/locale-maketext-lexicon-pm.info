Locale::Maketext::Lexicon, a module providing lexicon-handling backends, for
"Locale::Maketext" to read from other localization formats, such as PO files,
MO files, or from databases via the "Tie" interface.

For extracting translatable strings from source files, a "xgettext.pl" utility
is also installed by default.

You can also read my presentation "Web Localization in Perl" online at
http://www.autrijus.org/webl10n/. It gives an overview for the localization
process, features a comparison between Gettext, Msgcat and Maketext, and talks
about my experiences at localizing web applications based on HTML::Mason and
the Template Toolkit.
