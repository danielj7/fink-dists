DescUsage: <<
 By default, qtplay tries to play all files in the current directory. The
 -cd switch does not work in 10.2 because the Finder now renames the disc
 according to CDDB lookup. Switch to the cd directory first or specify it
 directly:

 qtplay "/Volumes/The CD Name"

 qtplay -h
 usage: qtplay [OPTION] [file(s)]
        qtplay [OPTION] -cd

 -l   loop
 -q   quiet
 -r   recursive
 -v   verbose
 -z   shuffle play
 -Z   random play

DescPackaging: <<
