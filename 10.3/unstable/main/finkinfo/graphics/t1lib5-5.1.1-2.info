Description: Generates bitmaps from Type 1 fonts
DescPackaging: <<
  Although t1lib5 as a separate package is obsolete, this collection of
  headers and library links is being provided during the transition
  period until t1lib5 has been completely replaced by t1lib5-x11 and
  t1lib5-nox.
<<
DescPort: <<
  Make sure libt1x, which uses x11, links against the x11 libs.
  libt1x also uses libt1, but cannot link against it because the
  libtool is tool old.
