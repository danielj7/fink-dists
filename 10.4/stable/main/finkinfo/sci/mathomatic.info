Package: mathomatic
Version: 10.8b
Revision: 1002
Description: Symbolic algebra program
DescDetail: <<
Mathomatic is a small, portable symbolic math program that can
automatically solve, simplify, differentiate, combine, and compare
algebraic equations, perform polynomial and complex arithmetic, etc.
<<
DescPort: <<
The makefile uses non-canonical *FLAGS so set the standard ones as
usual and then stuff them into what makefile uses.

Compile with readline support (following instructions in makefile).

Compiling using the linux instructions (source.txt) seems to work.

The makefile install target forces prefix=/usr/local and man1 loose in
prefix, so do it manually.

By default program is called 'am' (and was formerly also 'ac'), but
that sounds like parts of the GNU auto* toolchain so install as
"mathomatic".

Added missing -h to manpage synopsis.

This is *very* noisy with -Wall (implicit function prototypes; not
going to fix that) but did add missing #includes.

#The copyright (in readme.txt) is quite restrictive. The author has
#given explicit permission to include this package in Fink.
