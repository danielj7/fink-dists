Description: Purdue Compiler-Construction Tool Set (parser-generator)
DescPort: <<
 -specify cc as the compiler
 -share/man as the mandir
<<
DescPackaging: <<
 -there's no configure script
 -'make' builds and installs that's why it is placed in InstallScript and not in CompileScript
 -manually put headers in the package
<<
DescDetail: <<
 PCCTS, the Purdue Compiler Construction Tool Set, is a set of public-domain software tools
 designed to facilitate the construction of compilers and other translation systems.
 Although originally developed primarily for internal use within Purdue University,
 these tools are now everywhere. While working on his MS and PhD under Prof. Hank Dietz, T. Parr
 was the primary developer of PCCTS, and he has continued to maintain and extend it;
 see http://www.ANTLR.org/ for info on Ter's work on the latest Java versions.
