Description: Remote display system for X11
DescDetail: <<
Creates a virtual X11 windowing environment that can be viewed
not only on the machine where it is running, but from anywhere
on the Internet and from a wide variety of machine architectures.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
This package builds the vnc X11 viewer and server and places them in the
appropriate directories under <fink-root>.  It also installs some java 
classes and assorted webserver files in <fink-root>/share/vnc4/classes. 
The vncserver script uses the perl binarry installed in /usr/bin/perl.

In a future release, this package may be split in two (vnc-viewer and
vnc-server) to reduce package size and compile time.
<<
DescPort: <<
Installs plain vanilla vnc with all server and client binaries.  
Includes mini http server and java applet for remote access via a web browser.

Because of the packaging changes made with 4.0, this now downloads and 
compiles an entire X11R6 distribution to build the server.  Due to the nature
of Darwin's XFree86 port (use of the IOKit), the vnc module that allows vnc
remoting of the :0 display (i.e. turns a native Xserver into a VNC server)
is unavailable.  It would not be very useful unless running Darwin without
the Aqua window server.
