Package: jbig2dec
Version: 0.10
Revision: 2
Maintainer: Daniel Johnson <daniel@daniel-johnson.org>

Description: Decoder for JBIG2 image compression format
DescDetail: <<
	JBIG2 is designed for lossy or lossless encoding of 'bilevel' (1-bit
	monochrome) images at moderately high resolution, and in particular
	scanned paper documents. In this domain it is very efficient, offering
	compression ratios on the order of 100:1.

	This is a decoder only implementation, and currently is in the alpha
	stage, meaning it doesn't completely work yet. However, we are
	maintaining parity with available encoders, so it is useful for real
	work.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
	Patched to build shared library instead of static.
	Must use libpng3 not libpng14 as 14 doesn't have png_check_sig.
