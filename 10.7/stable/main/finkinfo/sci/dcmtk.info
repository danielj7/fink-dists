Description: Collection of DICOM libs and applications
DescDetail: <<
DCMTK is a collection of libraries and applications implementing large 
parts the DICOM standard for medical image communication. It includes 
software for examining, constructing and converting DICOM image files, 
handling offline media, sending and receiving images over a network 
connection, as well as demonstration image storage and worklist servers.
<<
DescUsage: <<
To use this toolkit, it is useful to have a basic knowledge of the 
DICOM standard for medical image communication. Starting points are
<http://medical.nema.org/dicom.html> which has an online version
of the standard and David Clunies website <http://www.dclunie.com>
which also hosts the alt.medical.image FAQ and other very good 
information.
<<
DescPort: <<
This port includes a patch from the Debian distribution to correctly
install the dicom.dic file into share/ instead of lib/, see
http://forum.dcmtk.org/viewtopic.php?t=572 for more information.
