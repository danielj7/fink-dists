DescDetail: <<
QEMU is a generic and open source machine emulator and virtualizer.

When used as a machine emulator, QEMU can run OSes and programs made for
one machine (e.g. an ARM board) on a different machine (e.g. your own PC).
By using dynamic translation, it achieves very good performance.

When used as a virtualizer, QEMU achieves near native performances by
executing the guest code directly on the host CPU. QEMU supports
virtualization when executing under the Xen hypervisor or using the KVM
kernel module in Linux.  When using KVM, QEMU can virtualize x86, server
and embedded PowerPC, and S390 guests.

DescPort: <<
The systems darwin-user and bsd-user crashed, as well as compiling with
gcc-4.2 or later. Bug reports are filed with upstream.
