DescDetail: <<
Command-line utility that wraps quickly two or more mp3 files in one 
single large playable mp3, without losing filenames and ID3 informations 
(and without need of decoding/encoding).

Also with the possibility of including other non mp3 files, such as 
PlayLists, info files, cover images, inside the mp3. This means that 
you obtain a large mp3 that you can split in any moment just using 
mp3splt and in few seconds you have all original files again! It's useful
because files created with Mp3Wrap are easy to download. Infact who 
downloads has not to know each single song name and easy to play and 
even if you don't have mp3splt to split file, you can listen to it 
anyway.
