DescDetail: <<
clearmailspool is a handy little script for new admins who are
still learning how to administer sendmail.
 
I have some mail sitting in /var/spool/clientmqueue that never
seems to get sent.  "mailq -Ac" claims that the queue is empty,
but looking in the directory I see a large amount of held mail.

This sendmail invocation will unclog your mail spool:
/usr/sbin/sendmail -Ac -q -v
