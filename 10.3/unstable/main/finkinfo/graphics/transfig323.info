Description: Converts xfig objs to various graphics formats (old version)
DescPort: We don't need xpm since it is already in XFree86 4.1

 Compiled with LaTeX 2e options chosen rather than LaTeX
 2.09. XFIGLIBDIR was set to %p/share/xfig (as in xfig).  
<<
DescUsage: <<
 This package is automatically called by xfig, although it is
 also possible to invoke "fig2dev" directly from the command line.
