DescDetail: <<
An easy to use text editor.  Intended to be usable with little or no 
instruction.  Provides both a terminal (curses based) interface and native 
X-Window interface (in which case the executable is called xae).  Features 
include pop-up menus, journalling (to recover from system crash or loss of 
connection), cut-and-paste, multiple buffers (associated with files or not), 
and much more.  aee is a superset of 'ee', a simplified text editor.  

rae and rxae are the same as aee and xae respectively, except that they are 
restricted to editing the file(s) named on the invoking command line.  No 
other files may be opened or written, nor may shell operations be performed.  
<<
DescUsage: <<
Function keys work fine in xae, but for aee they only work for some terminals 
(like rxvt and Eterm) and not others (like Terminal.app and xterm).  The 
function keys do, however, have control key equivalents, and can also be 
mapped to any control key combination.  See the man page, aee(1), for details.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
Had to patch source code and man page to replace /usr/local/* with %p/* 
equivalents.  Patched makefiles to include the -O3 CFLAG and to use local 
curses and not new_curses.
