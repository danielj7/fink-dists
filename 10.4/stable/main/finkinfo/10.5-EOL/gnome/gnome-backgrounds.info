Description: Backgrounds for GNOME
DescDetail: <<
The gnome-backgrounds package contains a set 
of backgrounds used in the GNOME desktop.
<<
DescUsage: <<
Basic Usage:
Right-click on the gnome desktop to change the background 
colors or add a wall-paper.
Tip:
Apart from the images offered by the tool, you may load
whichever image you want (jpg, svg, png, tiff, etc.), 
especially the Mac OS X Desktop or User Pictures.
Workaround:
The package installs various images under subdirectories 
of %p/share/pixmaps/backgrounds/gnome/.
It maybe that some images do not show up as thumbnails on
the left side of the gnome-background-properties tool.
In this case, choose them as wall-paper, quit the tool 
and the gnome environment, then relaunch it, the image 
will show up. 
Repeat the process until all images show up as thumbnails.
