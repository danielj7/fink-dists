Description: Python interface to databases
DescDetail: <<

SQLObject is a popular Object Relational Manager for providing an
object interface to your database, with tables as classes, rows as
instances, and columns as attributes.

SQLObject includes a Python-object-based query language that makes SQL
more abstract, and provides substantial database independence for
applications.

Supports MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, Firebird, Sybase, and MaxDB
(SAPDB).

DescPort: <<

Does not depend on a database package because it can use anyone of
many.  It would suck to depend on many.  May it should at a minimum
depend on sqlite as that is so light weight.
