Description: GUI Frontend for mysql
DescDetail: <<
xMySQLadmin is a front end to the MySQL database engine.  
It allows reloads, status check, process control, isamcheck,
grant/revoke privileges, creating databases, drop databases,
create, alter, browse and drop tables.
<<
DescPort: <<
I had to hand edit the makefile. xmysqladmin can use the mysql.server
script (normally located in %p/share/mysql/) to startup and (theoretically)
shutdown the mysql server. The location of the mysql.server script is
now correctly resolved at compile time.
