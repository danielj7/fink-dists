DescDetail: <<
	cc65 is a complete cross development package for 65(C)02 systems,
	including a powerful macro assembler, a C compiler, linker, librarian
	and several other tools. It is based on a C compiler that was
	originally adapted for the Atari 8bit computers by John R. Dunning. The
	original C compiler is a Small C descendant but has several extensions,
	and some of the limits of the original Small C compiler are gone. The
	original copyright allows free redistribution including sources, even
	if it would not qualify as Open Source Software according to the Open
	Source Definition.
	
	Supported targets are: Commodore C64, GEOS operating system for the
	Commodore C64, Commodore C128, Commodore C16, C116 and Plus/4,
