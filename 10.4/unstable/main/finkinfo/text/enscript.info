# DISCLAIMER: Max Horn is the sole maintainer of this package.
# Please DO NOT MAKE MODIFICATIONS without informing the maintainer.
# Preferably, send a patch to me instead of making changes yourself!
# If that is not possible due to extra urgency, at least send me a mail.
#
# Explanation: I am sick and tired of getting back to my packages and
# discovering that people have messed with it. I am then forced to
# retrace their steps, find out who, when and why did make a certain
# change etc. -- i.e. it makes my life as maintainer harder.
# Furthermore, as maintainer I am responsible for problems caused by my
# packages. But I am not willing to take responsibility for something I
# did not do. In particular, for changes that other people introduced
# behind my back, no matter how good and noble their intentions were. As
# such, I may see myself forced to drop responsibility for (and hence,
# maintainership of) the affected package.

Description: Converts text files to PostScript
DescDetail: <<
Enscript converts text files to PostScript and spools gen-
erated PostScript output to the specified printer or
leaves it to file.  If no input files are given, enscript
processes standard input.  Enscript can be extended to
handle different output media and it has many options
which can be used to customize printouts.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
I created this package because the enscript 1.6.1 that ships
with Mac OS X (10.1) seems to be broken on all machines I could
check (6 different installations). More specifically, the states
program which enscript uses for pretty-printing was not able to
parse the supplied enscript.st file
This straighforward package works now as expected and therefore
also allows html-export.
<<
DescPort: <<
Natively supports Mac OS X.
