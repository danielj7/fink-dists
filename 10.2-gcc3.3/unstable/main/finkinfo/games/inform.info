Description: Interactive fiction language and compiler
DescDetail: <<
Inform is the language and compiler used to create "Z-Code" Interactive Fiction 
games, playable by interpreters such as frotz.
<<
DescUsage: <<
To compile an inform game, simply type (for example)
"inform -ix /sw/share/doc/inform/demos/advent.inf".
Games can be played using "frotz" (also in fink).
<<
DescPort: <<
Patch needed to prevent makefile from linking over its own files. 
(it links for example "Parser.h" to "parser.h". However the HFS+ filesystem 
can't handle this. 
On UFS, the links will actually be required, so this package is only 
suitable for HFS+ disks. If UFS is desired, simply comment out the patch line.
