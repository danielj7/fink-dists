DescDetail: <<
Mp3Splt-project is a utility to split mp3 and ogg files selecting
a begin and an end time position, without decoding.
It's very useful to split large mp3/ogg to make smaller files
or to split entire albums to obtain original tracks. If you want
to split an album, you can select split points and filenames
manually or you can get them automatically from CDDB
(internet or a local file) or from .cue files. Supports also
automatic silence split, that can be used also to adjust
cddb/cue splitpoints. You can extract tracks from Mp3Wrap
or AlbumWrap files in few seconds. For mp3 files, both
ID3v1 & ID3v2 tags are supported.
