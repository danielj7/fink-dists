  DescDetail: <<
    A simple C-callable API that allows Ploticus to be embedded in other
    applications, and facilitates interfaces to Perl, PHP, Python, etc.
    This build does not support X11.
    
    Note that there is no header file for this library.

    Changes to Makefile_api
    =======================

    (Un)commented the Mac OS X section.
    
    Copied the XLIBS and ADDLIBS make variables from the main Makefile
    in order to build a dynamic shared library. Added an appropriate cc
    command to actually build the library.
  
    Patched all locations that are somewhere in the fink tree, as noted
    for the main package.

    Uncommented the NOXFLAG section to disable X11 support, added
    XLIBS = and XINCLUDEDIR =.
  
    Set FLAGS = -fno-common, GDLEVEL = -DGD18, GDOBJ =, GDHEADERS =
    -I@PREFIX@/include, GDFREETYPE = -DGDFREETYPE.
  
    Enabled all output options and locale support.
  <<
  DescPackaging: <<
    Note that we include the static library in this package as well as
    the shared libraries, because the Ploticus API is completely
    independent of the binary. It therefore doesn't really make sense to
    include the static library in the main package as per the Fink
    shared library policy.

    The main package isn't required, but it is recommended because it
    includes the prefabs directory and more importantly, the ploticus
    documentation :) I have at least included in this package the API
    documentation and a usage example.
    
    Note that there is no header file for this library.

## Additional data
##
DescDetail: <<
  Ploticus is free GPL software that generates plots and graphs from
  data. The primary components are the ploticus program and libploticus
  C language API. Create basic plots quickly from the command line using
  prefabs, or write customized scripts for maximum power and
  flexibility. You can invoke it manually, automatically from other
  programs, or directly as a CGI. Produce PNG, SVG or JPEG (with
  optional click map) for web pages, and for import into documents and
  slide presentations. PostScript and EPS are supported for paper
  reports and posters. Ploticus accepts tabular ascii data input.
  Numerics, alphanumeric categories, dates and times (in a variety of
  notations) can be plotted directly. You can also compute frequency
  distributions, correlation coefficients, curves, regression lines,
  medians, quartiles, etc. Ploticus is available for a number of
  platforms.
  
  This build does not support X11.
  
  Full HTML documentation and examples are included with the package.

  Changes to Makefile
  ===================
  
  (Un)commented the appropriate section (the section for Linux/FreeBSD).
  We're compiling with all features switched on (except X11 support, see
  below), so set the ploticus target to plgd18.
   
  Patched all locations that are somewhere in the fink tree. This
  defaults to %p and is passed in from the compile script. (Thanks to
  Jeff Whitaker for pointing this out.)
  
  Added -L@PREFIX@/lib to ADDLIBS (also see libfreetype comment below)
  and -I@PREFIX@/include to GD18H.

  Set FLAGS = -dynamic to force use of dynamic shared libraries rather
  than static ones.
 
  Set PL = ploticus (defines the name of the binary) to avoid a conflict
  with pre-existing /usr/bin/pl.
  
  The ploticus prefabs directory is hardcoded as %p/share/%n/prefabs
  (passed in from the compile script via the PREFABS_DIR make variable).
  
  Uncommented the NOXFLAG section to disable X11 support, added
  XINCLUDEDIR =.

  This build of Ploticus doesn't link with X11, so we technically don't
  have the same problem with dual copies of libfreetype that the
  ploticus2 package does (see the ploticus2 package description for more
  details). However, it is still possible that someone might choose to
  install ploticus2-nox even though they have X11 installed. We
  therefore still need -dylib_file
  /usr/X11R6/lib/libfreetype.6.dylib:@PREFIX@/lib/libfreetype.6.dylib in
  the GD18LIBS makefile variable to force ld to link to
  /sw/lib/libfreetype. This still appears to work OK even when
  /usr/X11R6/lib/libfreetype.6.dylib doesn't exist (phew!).
  
  Enabled locale support.

DescPackaging: <<
  Patches the makefiles to compile properly under Darwin. Also applies
  any late patches from the Ploticus author before compiling. (Current
  patches: Makefile_api, proc_processdata.c, proc_axis.c.)
  
  A slight peculiarity of the compile process: we have to do a "make -f
  Makefile_api clean" before actually making the shared libraries. This
  is because the author appears to have accidentally left a couple of
  ELF object files in the source directory. Doing the make clean first
  disposes of these safely, as they of course aren't overwritten by the
  normal make process.
  
  Note that there are no header files for the ploticus API shared
  libary. That's why the package doesn't install any :)  and why it
  doesn't need a BuildDependsOnly line. Also, the main package is
  totally independent of the -shlibs package, which is why it doesn't
  depend on it as you might normally expect.
 
  Although the full documentation is a separate download, it is included
  in this package because Ploticus is somewhat non-intuitive. The full
  documentation comes with a comprehensive gallery of fully-documented
  examples.
  
  I've patched the documentation to change most references to "pl" (the
  original binary name) to "ploticus". I've also removed most references
  to GIF since this build doesn't support pseudo-GIF creation (not for
  any political reasons --- the Makefile simply doesn't include it when
  you enable all the other formats). Similarly, since this build doesn't
  support X11, I've done the same for most X11 references. Obviously, it
  would be improper to change any references that are are historical in
  nature, refer to a package for another operating system or are in a
  feedback email, so I've left these as they are. I also fixed the odd
  typo that I noticed :) The upshot of all this is that the Fink package
  documentation differs somewhat from the official documentation
  provided at the ploticus web site. It also makes for a big patch
  (>200KB), but I think it's justified, and not unheard of.

  Note: A precompiled Mac OS X binary is available from the Ploticus web
  site. It doesn't support X11 either.
