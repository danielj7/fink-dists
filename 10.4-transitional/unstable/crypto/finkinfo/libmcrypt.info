Description:  Encryption/Decryption Library
DescDetail: <<
libmcrypt is the library which implements all the algorithms and modes
found in mcrypt. It is currently under development but it seems to work
pretty good. Unlike most encryption libraries libmcrypt does not have
everything (random number generators, hashes, hmac implementation, key
exchange, public key encryption etc.). Libmcrypt only implements an
interface to access block and stream encryption algorithms. It's purpose
was to assist in the development of mcrypt by providing a uniform
interface to access several different encryption algorithms, so that the
main program is independent of the encryption algorithms and the modes
used.

Libmcrypt supports the algorithms: BLOWFISH, TWOFISH, DES, TripleDES,
3-WAY, SAFER-sk64, SAFER-sk128, SAFER+, LOKI97, GOST, RC2, RC6, MARS,
IDEA, RIJNDAEL-128 (AES), RIJNDAEL-192, RIJNDAEL-256, SERPENT, CAST-128
(known as CAST5), CAST-256, ARCFOUR and WAKE. Block algorithms can be
used in: CBC, ECB, CFB and OFB (8 bit and n bit, where n is the size of
the algorithm's block length).

DescPackaging: <<

NOTE: 
Since 2.5.4 libmcrypt does not use dynamic loading for the modules by default.
All the algorithms and modes, are now included in the library. That way you can 
statically link the library and be 100% thread safe, since dlopen is not always 
thread safe.

Configure algorithms [optional]
# --with-included-algos="rijndael-128 arcfour stream cbc cfb md5"

libmcrypt-2.5.5 does not have support for INSTALL_ROOT use DESTDIR=%d.

make check
Algorithm: panama... failed internally
Bug report submitted
Do not use this method, it will crash. All other test ok.
