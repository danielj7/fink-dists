Description: Extracts metadata from VCS repositories
DescDetail: <<
Extracts metadata about the current revision from your repository. This
program is meant to be used by project build systems to extract
properties that can be used in software version strings. Repository
types supported include git, hg, bzr, and svn. It can create files
containing variable and macro definitions suitable for C, C++, Java,
sh, Python, Perl, PHP, lua, Javascript, and header files suitable for
use with preprocessing Info.plist files. Emitted information includes
the ID of the most recent commit, its branch, its date, and several
other useful pieces of meta-information. There is support for reading
and writing a cache file so autorevision will remain useful during a
build from an unpacked distribution tarball.
