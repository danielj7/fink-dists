# Additional Info
DescDetail: <<
TkCVS is a Tcl/Tk-based graphical interface to the CVS 
configuration management system. It displays the status 
of the files in the current working directory, and provides 
buttons and menus to execute CVS commands on the selected files. 

TkCVS extends CVS with a method to produce a browsable, 
"user friendly" listing of modules in the repository. This 
requires that the CVSROOT/modules file actually lists some 
modules. Additional comment fields can be added to make 
the browser more informative.

The graphical 2 and 3-way diff/merge tool TkDiff is included in this
package and can be used by itself.

It has integrated support for AccuRev/CM, CVS, Perforce, PVCS, RCS, 
SCCS, and SVN (subversion).
<<
DescUsage: <<
Remote repositories are supported, although the login step must 
be done at the commandline.

Then type 'tkcvs' to start up TkCVS

You can put personal preferences in a file called .tkcvs in your 
home directory.  User interface preferences should usually go there.

Type 'man tkcvs' to get help.
Type 'tkdiff' and open the help menu for more information about TkDiff.

TkDiff might also be used as an external diff command for Subversion (svn)
via an included wrapper. If you have svn installed add this line to your 
'~/.subversion/config' file under the '[helpers]' section:

diff-cmd = tkdiff-svn-wrapper

DescPackaging: <<
The patch from 
<http://sf.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=981930&group_id=64960&atid=509274>
is added to show correct labels when used via tkdiff-svn-wrapper.
