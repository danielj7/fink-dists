Description: Foreign Function Interface package for Python
DescDetail: <<
 ctypes is an advanced ffi (Foreign Function Interface) package for Python 2.3
 and higher.

 ctypes allows to call functions exposed from dlls/shared libraries and has ex-
 tensive facilities to create, access and manipulate simple and complicated C
 data types in Python - in other words: wrap libraries in pure Python. It is
 even possible to implement C callback functions in pure Python.

 ctypes now includes a code generator toolchain which allows automatic creation
 of library wrappers from C header files. This feature is still experimental
 and beta quality.

 ctypes works on Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, OpenBSD. It may
 also run on other systems, provided that libffi supports this platform.

DescPackaging: <<
 Patches ctypes/macholib/dyld.py to make the library loader search in fink's
 lib-folder, too.

 On i386-darwin, build crashes:
   configure: error: "libffi has not been ported to i686-apple-darwin8.6.1."
   Configuring static FFI library:
   cd build/temp.darwin-8.6.1-i386-2.4/libffi && env CFLAGS='' '/sw/build.build/ctypes-py24-0.9.9.3-2/ctypes-0.9.9.3/source/libffi/configure' 
   Failed
