Description: Java-based publishing framework
DescDetail: <<
Apache Forrest is a publishing framework that transforms input from
various sources into a unified presentation in one or more output
formats.  The modular and extensible plugin architecture is based on
Apache Cocoon and relevant standards, which separates presentation
from content.  Forrest can generate static documents, or be used as
a dynamic server, or be deployed by its automated facility.
