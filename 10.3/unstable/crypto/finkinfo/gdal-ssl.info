DescDetail: <<
GDAL is a translator library for raster geospatial data formats. As a library,
it presents a single abstract data model to the calling application for all
supported formats.

Current translators include GeoTIFF (read/write), Erdas Imagine (read),
ESRI .BIL (read/write), .aux labelled raw (read/write), DTED (read),
SDTS DEM (read), CEOS (read), JPEG (read/write), PNG (read/write),
Geosoft GXF (read), Arc/Info Binary Grid (read), FITS (read/write),
netCDF (limited read/write), and GIF (read/write).

DescPort: <<
The large number of gdal include files are moved into their own
subdirectory and gdal-conf has been patched to have the correct
include file path.

Uses -Os, otherwise it compiles with no optimization.

Uses --with-local=%p in ConfigureParams to have -I%p/include and
-L%p/lib be used in compiling this package.  But even with this set,
not all files are compiled with -I%p/include and so this is put in
SetCFLAGS and SetCXXFLAGS.

Uses --with-static-proj4=%p in ConfigureParams, but libproj still ends
up linking dynamically.

Uses --with-grass=no in ConfigureParams to avoid conflicts with the
use of GDAL within GRASS.

Uses --with-hdf4=no in ConfigureParams to avoid a compile error in
EHapi.c.

Franks Warmerdam says using the "internal" settings should not be
necessary, as the libs are tested to see if they are compatible.

TODO:

There are lots of other formats/libs that could be enabled, but have
not yet been tried.
