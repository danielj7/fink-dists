Description: GNU multiple precision arithmetic library
DescDetail: <<
 GNU MP is a portable library written in C for arbitrary precision 
 arithmetic on integers, rational numbers, and floating-point numbers.
<<
DescPort: <<
 Patch from Ben Hines to build libgmpxx, as of vers. 4.1-2.  As of vers.
 4.1.4-1, libgmpxx gets its own splitoff.

 The C++ wrapper library should be used with some care, as it fails one
 of the tests from "make check."  For the moment, that test has been
 patched out so that the library can still be installed.

 Following advice from the upsteam maintainer, we compile this with
 gcc 3.3 rather than gcc 4.0.0.  It is hoped that using gcc 4.0.1 (or 
 later) will be OK at some point in the future.

 Instead of building with --enable-mpfr, we now suggest using the libmpfr1
 package.
