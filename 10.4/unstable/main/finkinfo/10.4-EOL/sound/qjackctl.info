DescDetail: <<
QjackCtl is a simple Qt application to control the JACK sound server
daemon, specific for the Linux Audio Desktop infrastructure.  

Written in C++ around the Qt4 toolkit for X11, most exclusively using
Qt Designer.  

Provides a simple GUI dialog for setting several JACK daemon
parameters, which are properly saved between sessions, and a way
control of the status of the audio server daemon. With time, this
primordial interface has become richer by including a enhanced
patchbay and connection control features.
