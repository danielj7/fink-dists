# Additional Info:
DescUsage: <<
Note: Various versions of the CPAN module may prefer to have the main
directory at ~/Library/Application Support/.cpan instead of the more
unixish ~/.cpan location. The directory itself seems the same and can
be via symlink in either direction.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
	The old cpan-pmXXX-bin packages are re-incorporated
	into the cpan-pmXXX packages as of 1.76-3/1.94.2-1.

	module-build-pm only used for building so not Depends for fink
	because we're a package-manager that gets confused when CPAN
	is used to install modules directly

	Has a ton of optional deps (not all of which are in fink),
	some (many?) of which have system() workarounds, or are only
	used rarely and/or give good diagnostics if not available when
	needed. Therefore not piling up Depends. Easy enough to add
	them if becomes popular and needed in the future.

	Patching files changes their SHA1; changing the SHA1s in
	SIGNATURE makes the gpg verification of that file fail (which
	cannot be fixed) so why bother?

	Fix detection of path to perl interp. See:
	https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=70645

	Don't whine about missing module if the mode that would use it
	isn't active. See:
	https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=71028
