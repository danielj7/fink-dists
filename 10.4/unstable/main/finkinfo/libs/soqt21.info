Description: QT GUI lib for OpenInventor/Coin3D
DescDetail: <<
Use Trolltech Qt/X11 for an OpenInventor GUI.  This provides the X11
interface for the Coin/Inventor 3D scene graph library originally
designed by SGI.  SGI originally only had an X11/Xt GUI library called
SoXt.  SoQt is much like SoQt, but is better maintained.  SoXt does
not currently seem to work on Mac OSX.  There is also an SoGtk which
is not well maintained.
<<
DescPort: <<
The dev splitoff needs qt3 as that is the home of bin/moc.
