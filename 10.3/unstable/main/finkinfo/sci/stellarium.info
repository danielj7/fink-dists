DescDetail: <<
  Stellarium renders a real time, photorealistic 3D image of the sky using
  OpenGL. Its features include:
  
  Over 120000 stars from the Hipparcos Catalogue with name and info for
    the brightest ones.
  Planets and major satellites in real time, with a powerfull zoom mode
    to see them like in a telescope.
  Planet position computation now accurate enough for eclipse or transit
    simulation.
  Drawing of the 88 constellations with their names.
  Textured displaying of more than 70 nebulas (Orion, M31 etc..).
  Photorealistic Milky Way.
  Ground, fog, and landscape.
  Ultra fast realistic atmosphere rendering.
  Automatic eye adaptation to luminance.
  Star twinkling.
  Smooth real time intuitive navigation.
  Equatorial and altazimutal mode.
  Fisheye projection mode (e.g for planetarium dome).
  Grids in Equatorial and Azimuthal coordinates.
  Time control (real time and accelered time modes).
  Graphical menu for simple utilisation.
  Clikable stars, planets and nebulas with information.
  Ecliptic and celestrial equator lines.
  Windowed and fullscreen modes.

DescPort: <<
  Patched configure to link with libmx.dylib, needed for some math functions.
  Removed "-s" flag from linking as this can cause crashing when built with
  Xcode before 1.5. MacOS X doesn't have daylight or timezone variables, so
  had to change timezone code. Patched main.cpp to save configuration file
  in ~/.stellarium/config.ini instead of %p/share/stellarium/config/config.ini
<<
DescUsage: <<
  User interface uses SDL and OpenGL; X11 is NOT used. Can be run from
  Terminal.app without X11 running. Due to limitations of SDL library,
  stellarium will NOT work if X11 is also running in full screen mode;
  rootless mode is fine.
