DescDetail: <<
Celestia is a free real-time space simulation that lets you experience 
our universe in three dimensions. Unlike most planetarium software, 
Celestia doesn't confine you to the surface of the Earth. You can travel 
throughout the solar system, to any of over 100,000 stars, or even beyond 
the galaxy. All travel in Celestia is seamless; the exponential zoom 
feature lets you explore space across a huge range of scales, from galaxy 
clusters down to spacecraft only a few meters across. A 'point-and-goto' 
interface makes it simple to navigate through the universe to the object 
you want to visit.
<<
DescUsage: <<
Once installed, read the README at %p/share/doc/celestia-gtk/README 
(preferred) or type 'file://%p/share/apps/celestia/manual/celestia.html' 
into a web browser to view the manual. Typing 'celestia' in an 
x-terminal begins the program.
