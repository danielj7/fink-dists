DescDetail: <<
 Under 10.5, this package provides the xmkmf script and the imake executable
 and their supporting config files that are no longer supplied with the
 X11R7 release from x.org.

 Under 10.4, this package simply gives symlinks to the appropriate files in 
 /usr/X11R6 (so that .info files which work in both 10.4 and 10.5 can easily 
 be constructed).

 Thanks to Martin Costabel and Benjamin Reed for earlier versions.
<<
DescUsage: <<
 In order to use xmkmf and imake to compile legacy packages (under 10.4
 or 10.5), one should have a BuildDepends on the present package, and supply
    export PATH=%p/lib/xmkmf/bin:$PATH 
    export IMAKEINCLUDE=-I%p/lib/X11/config
 in the CompileScript and InstallScript of the packages.

 Failing to do this runs the risk that some users may not have xmkmf and/or
 imake (or the necessary config files) available at build time.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
 The revision number of the 10.5 version is kept higher than that of the 10.4
 version so that users who are upgrading from 10.4 to 10.5 will have this
 package replaced by the correct, new version.
