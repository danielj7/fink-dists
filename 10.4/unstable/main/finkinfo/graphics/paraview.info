Description: Visualization application for large data sets
DescDetail: << 
 ParaView is an application designed with the need to visualize 
 large data sets in mind. The goals of the ParaView       
 project include the following:
   * Develop an open-source, multi-platform visualization application.
   * Support distributed computation models to process large data sets.
   * Create an open, flexible, and intuitive user interface.
   * Develop an extensible architecture based on open standards. 
 ParaView runs on distributed and shared memory parallel as well as 
 single processor systems and has been succesfully tested on Windows, 
 Linux and various Unix workstations and clusters. 
 Under the hood, ParaView uses the Visualization Toolkit (VTK) as the 
 data processing and rendering engine and has a user interface written 
 using a unique blend of Tcl/Tk and C++.

DescUsage: <<
 Examples are provided in the %p/share/doc/%n/Examples folder.

<<
DescPackaging: <<
 No shlibs splitoff. Dylibs are only used internally,
 and they don't have reasonable compatibility versions.
<<
DescPort: <<
 The dylibs are still created with compat version 0.0.0, 
 because cmake doesn't know about compatibility versions.
 It is bad enough already to get them a decent install_name.

 Cmake knows now about versioned file names for dylibs, so 
 that a future repacked version will be able to adhere to 
 Fink's shlibs policy.
