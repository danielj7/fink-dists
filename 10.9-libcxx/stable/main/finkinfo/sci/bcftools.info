DescDetail: <<
BCFtools is a set of utilities that manipulate variant calls in the
Variant Call Format (VCF) and its binary counterpart BCF. All commands
work transparently with both VCFs and BCFs, both uncompressed and
BGZF-compressed.

Most commands accept VCF, bgzipped VCF and BCF with filetype detected
automatically even when streaming from a pipe. Indexed VCF and BCF will
work in all situations. Un-indexed VCF and BCF and streams will work in
most, but not all situations. In general, whenever multiple VCFs are
read simultaneously, they must be indexed and therefore also compressed.

BCFtools is designed to work on a stream. It regards an input file "-"
as the standard input (stdin) and outputs to the standard output
(stdout). Several commands can thus be combined with Unix pipes.
