Description: Manager for library compile/link flags
DescDetail: <<
pkg-config is a script to make putting together all the build
flags when compiling/linking a lot easier.
<<
DescUsage: <<
Version 0.20 adds support for *.private fields in .pc files. Older
versions ignore them and most fink packages that use pkg-config do not
need them. However, packages supplying .pc that have them should take
steps to ensure users who might need them don't accidentally use a
lower version of pkgconfig and thus get deficient flags.

Fink only adds support for the %p/share/pkgconfig directory in 0.20.
Packages supplying .pc there should take steps to ensure users don't
accidentally use a lower version of pkgconfig.

Current (as of 0.22-4) precedence of .pc searching is:
  1. fink arch-dependent
  2. fink arch-independent
  3. system X11 (recent-version location)
  4. system X11 (older-version location)
  5. system itself
pkg-config uses a strict "first match" search scheme.

As of 0.22-4, lists of -I and -L flags are re-sorted to place all
fink paths before any system (/usr or X11) paths; other paths come
first, so PKG_CONFIG_PATH should allow users to over-ride fink, but fink
always over-rides system-supplied paths).
<<
DescPort: <<
  Starting with 0.17.2, Link to Fink's glib pkg instead of static-link
  to included glib-1.2.8 since we have newer and better-OSX-tweaked
  glib than that now.

  Omitting --enable-indirect-deps gives a binary that gives identical
  results for --libs and --cflags for the fink-supplied pkgconfig/*.pc
  collection as 0.17.2-2 (with --enable-indirect-deps), including ones
  that have Requires and ones that have .private fields. The binary
  still fails some tests (appears to do depth-first recursing through
  Requires but expects breadth-first), so we disable those.

  Upstream seems rather disinterested in solving this self-test mess.
