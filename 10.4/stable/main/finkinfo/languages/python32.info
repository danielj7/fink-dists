 Description: Generic "python3" command that invokes python%type_pkg[python]
<<
DocFiles: README LICENSE 
Description: Interpreted, object-oriented language
DescDetail: <<
 Python is often compared to Tcl, Perl, Scheme or Java. 
 This package installs unix python - not the OSX Framework version.
 Builds a two-level namespace dynamic libpython (needed for koffice).

 The interpretter is installed as "python%type_raw[python]", and all associated
 commands are similarly named with the python-version in them. To get
 the simple "python3" command, install the fink package "python3" (note:
 the "python3" command there is not guaranteed to be python%type_raw[python]!).
<<
DescUsage: <<
	python%type_raw[python] changes the compiler options used to compile
	third-party python modules. Please do not add %type_raw[python] variants
	to them without actually testing that they build cleanly.
<<

DescPackaging: <<
	Patch a lot of things to impliment shared-lib support for
	non-Framework build on Darwin.

	Static libpython is installed in lib/pythonX.X/config-%type_raw[python]m/ but
	shared goes in %p/lib by default. Fink's packaging has always
	placed manually-built shared lib in config/ along side static,
	This gives consistency regardless of -search_paths_first.
	Continue this practice so that -pyXX varianted packages don't
	need special-casing for certain variants.

	Make sure all compiled modules link against libpython%type_raw[python] (and
	propagate this to third-party compiled modules) to ensure that
	all symbols resolved at compile-time to avoid packager
	mistakes and user runtime surprises.

	Play lots of games to make sure we get expected support
	libraries. Also make sure -L/sw/lib/system-openssl is passed
	before -L/sw (build system seems to confuse standard meanings
	and uses of CFLAGS vs CPPFLAGS vs LDFLAGS) but avoid
	propagating into modules that compile using distutils.

	Adjust "python3" unversioned link to be a symlink not a hard link.

	Shared lib is buried next to static one instead of being in
	%p/lib because that's where it's always been in the fink
	package series. Why would they be in different places? Patch
	-config script to continue this tradition (bug in previous
	versions accidentally did the Right Thing here).
	
	New in 3.2, .pyc files are saved in the __pycache__ directory
	at the same level as the matching .py file. Any packages that
	expect the .pyc file to be next to the .py file will need adjustment.
	
	The .pyc and .so files also include the python version in the name.
<<
DescPort: <<
	libpython needs to link to CF because that lib has the parent
	thread that load modules that need to have CF available. See:
	http://bugs.python.org/issue7085

	bsddb is gone so drop db* patch and dep.
	Patch setup.py to find ncursesw headers and drop libncurses5 dep.
	Ensure $(LDFLAGS) is used linking libpython or else it can't find libintl.
	
	test_ctypes fails with clang unless _ctypes/_ctypes_test.c is built
	with -O0 so force that in setup.py.
	
	Patch ctypes to look in %p/lib for libraries.
