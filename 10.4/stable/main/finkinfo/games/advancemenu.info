DescPort: <<
Doesn't work as a frontend for xmame, since SDL in fink uses aqua. 
<<
DescPackaging: <<
Added patches to support $DESTDIR. Changed the default $DATADIR to 
%p/share/%n from %p/share/advance to avoid conflict with advancemame. 
Added patches to add necessary #includes to advance/linux/itty.c. 
Removed lines that search for non-supported xmame files. Binary files 
advcfg and advv put in %i/share/%n/bin to avoid a conflict with identical 
files in advancemame. Man files for advcfg and advv put in 
%i/share/%n/man/man1.
<<
DescUsage: <<
The basic command is 'advmenu'. The first invocation of advmenu 
sets up a configuration file at ~/.advance/advmenu.rc. Edit this 
file to change preferences. Standard directory for advancemame 
roms is either ~/.advance/rom or %p/share/advancemame/rom. 
For more info, type 'man advmenu' or see %p/share/doc/%n
<<
DescDetail: <<
AdvanceMENU is a frontend for AdvanceMAME, MAME, MESS, RAINE and any other 
emulator.
