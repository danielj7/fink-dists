Description: Perl API to the Apache Xerces XML parser
DescDetail: <<
  Xerces-C is a validating XML parser written in C++.  Xerces-C
  conforms with the XML-1.0 W3C recommendation.

  This perl module has significant known issues with Mac OSX
  (including crash bugs), but the XML validation facilities work well
  enough for development work.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
  This Perl module is tightly bound to a specific version of the
  Xerces library, hence the -c23 infix.

  The Perl tests are known to fail on Mac OSX, so I've disabled them.
