Description: GUI for the CVS revision control system
DescDetail: <<
TkCVS is a Tcl/Tk-based graphical interface to the CVS 
configuration management system. It displays the status 
of the files in the current working directory, and provides 
buttons and menus to execute CVS commands on the selected files. 
TkDiff is included for browsing and merging your changes. 

TkCVS extends CVS with a method to produce a browsable, 
"user friendly" listing of modules in the repository. This 
requires that the CVSROOT/modules file actually lists some 
modules. Additional comment fields can be added to make 
the browser more informative
