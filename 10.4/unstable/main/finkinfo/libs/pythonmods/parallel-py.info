Description: Simple parallel processing for Python
DescDetail: <<
parallel-python is a python module which provides mechanism for parallel 
execution of python code on SMP (systems with multiple processors or cores) 
and clusters (computers connected via network). It is light, easy to install
and integrate with other python software.
parallel-python is an open source and cross-platform module written in pure python.

Features: 
* Parallel execution of python code on SMP and clusters
* Easy to understand and implement job-based parallelization technique (easy 
  to convert serial application in parallel)
* Automatic detection of the optimal configuration (by default the number of 
  worker processes is set to the number of the effective processors in the 
  system)
* Dynamic processors allocation (number of worker processes can be changed 
  at runtime)
* Low overhead for subsequent jobs with the same function (transparent 
  caching is implemented to decrease the overhead)
* Dynamic load balancing (jobs are distributed between processors at runtime)
* SHA based authentication for network connections
* Cross-platform portability (Windows, Linux, Unix)
