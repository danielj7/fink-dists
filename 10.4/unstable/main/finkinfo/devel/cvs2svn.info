# Additional Info:
DescDetail: <<
cvs2svn is a program that can be used to migrate a CVS repository to 
Subversion (otherwise known as "SVN"). The primary goal of cvs2svn is to 
migrate as much information as possible from your old CVS repository to your
new Subversion repository.

But unfortunately, CVS doesn't record complete information about your 
project's history. For example, CVS doesn't record what file modifications 
took place within the same CVS commit. Therefore, cvs2svn attempts to infer 
from CVS's incomplete information what really happened in the history of your
repository. So the second goal of cvs2svn is to reconstruct as much of your 
CVS repository's history as possible.

Type 'cvs2svn --help' or 'man cvs2svn' for help. Read the home page for more 
information - also available from 
%p/share/doc/%n-pyXX/www/cvs2svn.html

Check your new repository carefully after conversion. Mail 
users@cvs2svn.tigris.org if you encounter any problems. You can also ask
questions on IRC at irc.freenode.net, channel #cvs2svn.                        

You may use the tool 'verify-cvs2svn' to verify your conversion. But a
WARNING: The 'verify-cvs2svn' is not yet finished. It may produce false 
warnings or ignore serious problems. Don't trust it!
