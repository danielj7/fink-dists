Description: Hierarchical note manager
DescDetail:  <<
NoteCase is a hierarchical note manager (aka. outliner). It helps you organize
your everyday text notes into a single document, with individual notes placed 
in the tree-like structure (each note can have its sub-notes, ...).
To ensure your privacy, encrypted document format is supported, along with 
standard unencrypted format.

DescPort: <<
Upstream deactivated gnome-vfs2 support for OS X, but it isn't obvious why, so patch that out.
Try to patch in the proper path to the help file (but it's currently not working).
Don't put a ".x11app" suffix on the executable, because that's annoying.

DescUsage:  << 
The help file isn't accessible just yet via the GUI controls, but you can open
it manually.  It's in
%p/share/doc/%n/help.ncd
