DescDetail: <<
Steel Bank Common Lisp is an open source development system for ANSI
Common Lisp.  It provides an interactive environment including an
integrated native compiler, interpreter, and debugger.  Several
extensions, such as a foreign function interface, and support for Unix
(POSIX) system calls are also included.  SBCL is derived from CMU CL.

DescPort: <<
Uses a pre-compiled SBCL binary for bootstrapping.

At one point, the HTML documentation for this package included a file
whose name was so long that it was killing dpkg.  Thus, the following
bit used to be in the InstallScript section, but as of version 1.0.44,
it seems not to be needed anymore.  I include this because upstream
may reintroduce the problem, and we may need to reintroduce our solution.

# Due to a limitation with dpkg, we need to kill the following file,
# whose name is simply too long.  See 
#
#  http://article.gmane.org/gmane.os.macosx.fink.devel/18731
#
# to learn more about the strangeness that can ensue because of
# this limitation of dpkg.
