Description: Converts xfig objects to various graphics formats
DescPort: <<
 We don't need xpm since it is already in XFree86 4.1.

 Patch for gcc3.3 borrowed from gentoo.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
 Compiled with LaTeX 2e options chosen rather than LaTeX
 2.09. XFIGLIBDIR was set to %p/share/xfig (as in xfig).  
<<
DescUsage: <<
 This package is automatically called by xfig, although it is
 also possible to invoke "fig2dev" directly from the command line.
