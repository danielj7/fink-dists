DescDetail: <<
	Each NCO operator (e.g., ncks) takes netCDF or HDF input file(s),
	performs an operation (e.g., averaging, hyperslabbing, or renaming),
	and outputs a processed netCDF file. Although most users of
	netCDF and HDF data are involved in scientific research,
	these data formats, and thus NCO, are generic and
	are equally useful in fields like finance.
	This version is OPeNDAP/DODS enabled, so it can be given
	URLs to read remote datasets as if they were local
	netCDF files.
	The prior "nco" package is being left around for compatibility, in case
	users have built against those libraries.
<<

DescPort: <<
Get rid of hardcoded malloc.h for C++ stuff.
Patch out an -lnco that of course links to a library in the 
previously installed version of the package.
GSL support is disabled, at least for now, because of an 
undefined symbol error.
Upstream has gotten rid of building shared libraries except
when netcdf4 is used.  The netcdf4 and the DAP options are
exclusive, so when/if there is a netcdf4 package in Fink
there will need to be a separate version of this package.
