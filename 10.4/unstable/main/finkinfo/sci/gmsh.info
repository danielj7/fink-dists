Description: Three-dimensional finite element mesh generator
DescDetail: <<
 Gmsh is an automatic 3D finite element mesh generator (primarily Delaunay) 
 with build-in CAD and post-processing facilities. Its design goal is to provide a 
 simple meshing tool for academic test cases with parametric input and up to 
 date visualization capabilities. 
 Gmsh is built around four modules: geometry, mesh, solver and 
 post-processing. The specification of any input to these modules is done 
 either interactively using the graphical user interface or in ASCII text files 
 using Gmsh's own scripting language. 
 
 See Gmsh's reference manual for a more thorough overview of Gmsh's 
 capabilities.
