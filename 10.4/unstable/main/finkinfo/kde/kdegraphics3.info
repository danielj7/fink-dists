	DescUsage: <<
---[ Installation ]---------------------------------------------------

To install all of the official KDE packages, install "bundle-kde" or
"bundle-kde-ssl" (depending on whether crypotgraphic laws permit
downloading strong cryptography).  Unless you have a specific reason
not to, "bundle-kde-ssl" is suggested.

---[ Configuration ]--------------------------------------------------

To use KDE as your windowing system in XDarwin, create a file called
".xinitrc" in your home directory, containing the following line:

  /sw/bin/startkde >/tmp/kde.log 2>&1

See http://fink.sourceforge.net/doc/x11/run-xfree86.php#xinitrc
for more information on the xinitrc files and how they work.

If you want to use Apple's X11 instead of the KDE window manager,
put the following line before the startkde line in .xinitrc:

  export KDEWM=quartz-wm

If you want to disable quartz-wm even for clipboard synchronization
(proxying), put the following line before the startkde line in
.xinitrc:

  export DISABLE_PROXY=1

---[ Startup ]--------------------------------------------------------

Once you have created an ~/.xinitrc file, you should be able to start
KDE by clicking on the "XDarwin" icon in your Applications folder.  

NOTE: By default, X11 on Mac OS X runs in "rootless" mode, generally.
If you run KDE in rootless mode, it will take over your desktop with
a window that covers everything up.  You can remove this by disabling
desktop icons in the KDE control center.  Open the control center
(either from the "K" menu bar, or by typing "kcontrol" in an xterm)
then expand the "Desktop" list, click "Behavior", and uncheck the
"Show icons on desktop" checkbox.
   
---[ Removal ]--------------------------------------------------------
   
To remove all of the official KDE packages, you can remove the KDE
libraries and anything that depends on them by running, in a terminal:
   
  sudo apt-get remove kdelibs3-unified-shlibs

To remove an individual KDE package collection (like kdenetwork3 or
kdesdk3) you can generally remove [package]-base.  For example, to
remove all of the kdenetwork3 packages, run:

  sudo apt-get remove kdenetwork3-base

	Homepage: http://www.kpovmodeler.org/
	DescDetail: <<
KPovModeler is a modeling and composition program for creating POV-Ray(TM)
scenes in KDE.

For most of the modelers, POV-Ray is nothing but a rendering engine and
they bring a lot of limitations to the innate possibilities of POV-Ray
scripted language.  This is not the case for KPovModeler which allows you
to use all the features of POV-Ray through the translation of POV-Ray
language into a graphical tree.

Almost all options of POV-Ray's script language can be used within
KPovModeler.  "Almost" because variables, loop instructions, macros and
some operators can't directly be, unfortunately.  On the other hand,
KPovModeler allows you to include a part of a script with the "Raw POV-Ray"
tool; such a raw code will only be taken into account by POV-Ray during
the rendering stage.

Kooka is an intuitive, easy to use open source GNU/Linux scan program
which is released under the GNU General Public License with exceptions.

Kooka is the scan application of choice for the KDE project and thus it
is official part of the KDE Graphics Package.

Kooka helps you to handle the most important scan parameters, find the
correct image file format to save and manage your scanned images.  It
offers support for different OCR modules.  Libkscan, a autonomous part
of Kooka, provides a scan service for easy and consistent use to all
KDE applications.

KuickShow is an image browser/viewer with a nice filebrowser to select images to be
shown, slideshow support and the ability to display the following image formats: jpg,
gif, tiff, png, bmp, psd, xpm, xbm, pbm and eim.  Images can be displayed either in
their own window, as large as the image, or fullscreen (which shrinks images too
large to display).  KuickShow also has a slideshow mode.

---[ Installation ]---------------------------------------------------

To install all of the official KDE packages, install "bundle-kde" or
"bundle-kde-ssl" (depending on whether crypotgraphic laws permit
downloading strong cryptography).  Unless you have a specific reason
not to, "bundle-kde-ssl" is suggested.

---[ Configuration ]--------------------------------------------------

To use KDE as your windowing system in XDarwin, create a file called
".xinitrc" in your home directory, containing the following line:

  /sw/bin/startkde >/tmp/kde.log 2>&1

See http://fink.sourceforge.net/doc/x11/run-xfree86.php#xinitrc
for more information on the xinitrc files and how they work.

If you want to use Apple's X11 instead of the KDE window manager,
put the following line before the startkde line in .xinitrc:

  export KDEWM=quartz-wm

If you want to disable quartz-wm even for clipboard synchronization
(proxying), put the following line before the startkde line in
.xinitrc:

  export DISABLE_PROXY=1

---[ Startup ]--------------------------------------------------------

Once you have created an ~/.xinitrc file, you should be able to start
KDE by clicking on the "XDarwin" icon in your Applications folder.  

NOTE: By default, X11 on Mac OS X runs in "rootless" mode, generally.
If you run KDE in rootless mode, it will take over your desktop with
a window that covers everything up.  You can remove this by disabling
desktop icons in the KDE control center.  Open the control center
(either from the "K" menu bar, or by typing "kcontrol" in an xterm)
then expand the "Desktop" list, click "Behavior", and uncheck the
"Show icons on desktop" checkbox.
   
---[ Removal ]--------------------------------------------------------
   
To remove all of the official KDE packages, you can remove the KDE
libraries and anything that depends on them by running, in a terminal:
   
  sudo apt-get remove kdelibs3-unified-shlibs

To remove an individual KDE package collection (like kdenetwork3 or
kdesdk3) you can generally remove [package]-base.  For example, to
remove all of the kdenetwork3 packages, run:

  sudo apt-get remove kdenetwork3-base

	DescDetail: <<
KView is an image viewer program for the K Desktop Environment.  It
is distributed as a standard KDE component in the KDE Graphics package.

Features include:

	* Lots of formats. Support for GIF, JPEG, PNG, BMP, XBM, XPM, TIFF,
		PBM (P1), PGM (P2), PPM (P3), PBMRAW (P4), PGMRAW (P5) and
		PPMRAW (P6) image formats.  Experimental EPS support is also
		available.
	* Full integration with KDE, including session management,
		on-the-fly look and feel changing, fully configurable keybindings,
		URL drag and drop, multiple image viewers.
	* URL open support.  Open images from an ftp site or web server, or
		even an image within a tar.gz archive on a remote server.  As more
		protocols are added to the KDE IO subsystem, kview will
		automatically inherit them.
	* Full-featured slideshow system, including loop and shuffle.
	* Other standard viewer features: zoom, flip, rotate, resize,
		smooth, greyscale, gamma correct, set image as desktop background.
	* Image filter system, allowing easy extension of image processing
		capabilities using, for example, an external process.

To use KDE as your windowing system in XDarwin, create a file called
".xinitrc" in your home directory, containing the following line:

  /sw/bin/startkde >/tmp/kde.log 2>&1

See http://fink.sourceforge.net/doc/x11/run-xfree86.php#xinitrc
for more information on the xinitrc files and how they work.

If you want to use Apple's X11 instead of the KDE window manager,
put the following line before the startkde line in .xinitrc:

  export KDEWM=quartz-wm

If you want to disable quartz-wm even for clipboard synchronization
(proxying), put the following line before the startkde line in
.xinitrc:

  export DISABLE_PROXY=1

---[ Startup ]--------------------------------------------------------

Once you have created an ~/.xinitrc file, you should be able to start
KDE by clicking on the "XDarwin" icon in your Applications folder.  

NOTE: By default, X11 on Mac OS X runs in "rootless" mode, generally.
If you run KDE in rootless mode, it will take over your desktop with
a window that covers everything up.  You can remove this by disabling
desktop icons in the KDE control center.  Open the control center
(either from the "K" menu bar, or by typing "kcontrol" in an xterm)
then expand the "Desktop" list, click "Behavior", and uncheck the
"Show icons on desktop" checkbox.
   
---[ Removal ]--------------------------------------------------------
   
To remove all of the official KDE packages, you can remove the KDE
libraries and anything that depends on them by running, in a terminal:
   
  sudo apt-get remove kdelibs3-unified-shlibs

To remove an individual KDE package collection (like kdenetwork3 or
kdesdk3) you can generally remove [package]-base.  For example, to
remove all of the kdenetwork3 packages, run:

  sudo apt-get remove kdenetwork3-base
