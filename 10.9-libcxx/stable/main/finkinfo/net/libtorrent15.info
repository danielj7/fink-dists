DescPort: <<
fangism:
Some C++ related patching was necessary to get the source to compile against
g++-4.0, even though upstream requires g++-4.2 or higher.
Also, some POSIX APIs that were expected for atomic operations were 
mapped to darwin8 equivalents.  
Additional patching needed to C-cast (ewww...) address-of-unsigned to 
pointer-to-signed because of differences in the atomicity API.
