Description: X-ray data processing, small display version
DescDetail: <<
Mosflm is a program for integrating single crystal diffraction data 
from area detectors. It is assumed that the experiment was conducted
using the Arndt-Wonacott oscillation method, and also that 
monochromatic radiation was used.
Mosflm can process data from a wide variety of modern area 
detectors, e.g. from Mar Research, Rigaku/MSC, ADSC, DIP etc.

This small display version is suitable for laptops and 
lower-resolution monitors.  The large version is included in CCP4 by
default and the latest version is in the mosflm fink
package.
