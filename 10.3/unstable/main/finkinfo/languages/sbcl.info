DescDetail: <<
Steel Bank Common Lisp (SBCL) is an open source development system for
ANSI Common Lisp.  It provides an interactive environment including an
integrated high quality native compiler, interpreter, and a debugger.
<< 

DescUsage: <<
The environmental variable SBCL_HOME must be set to
'finkroot/lib/sbcl/' where 'finkroot' is the root directory of you
fink installation (in most cases '/sw') for SBCL to function
correctly.  Fink should take care of this for you in terminal
sessions, but you may also want to set this variable in your
.MacOSX/environment.plist file, if you have one, so SBCL can be run
from carbon Emacs and other Mac applications that may not be launched
from the terminal.  For more information about setting up a
~/.MacOSX/environment.plist file, see the following Apple tech note:

<<

DescPort: << 
Uses a binary version of SBCL for bootstrapping.  gnupg is needed to
validate common lisp packages downloaded with asdf-install.
