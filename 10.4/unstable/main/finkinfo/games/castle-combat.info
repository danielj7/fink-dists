Description: Clone of the old arcade game Rampart
DescDetail: <<
Castle-Combat is a clone of the old arcade game Rampart.
Up to four players (or more in future versions) build
castle walls, place cannons inside these walls, and
shoot at the walls of their enemy(s). If a player cannot
build a complete wall around one of his castles, he
loses. The last surviving player wins.

 Needs repair to avoid nested functions; for now, use gcc-3.3.
