Version: 1.5
Revision: 1
Description: Massively parallel LZMA file compressor
DescDetail: <<
	Plzip is a massively parallel (multi-threaded), lossless data
	compressor based on the LZMA algorithm, with very safe integrity
	checking and a user interface similar to the one of gzip or bzip2.
	Plzip uses the lzip file format; the files produced by plzip are fully
	compatible with lzip-1.4 or newer.

	Plzip is intended for faster compression/decompression of big files on
	multiprocessor machines, which makes it specially well suited for
	distribution of big software files and large scale data archiving. On
	files big enough, plzip can use hundreds of processors.
