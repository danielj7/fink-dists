Description: Circuit drawing app with schematic capture
DescUsage: <<
 Depending on your X11 environment, dialog boxes can get buried
behind the main window.

DescPackaging: <<
Needed to add -fno-common to CFLAGS.
Added -I/usr/X11R6/include to CFLAGS because it wouldn't work with 
CPPFLAGS.  This is needed because the linker apparently can't find
the X11 headers by default on XFree86 or Xorg.
Prior versions by Max Horn.
