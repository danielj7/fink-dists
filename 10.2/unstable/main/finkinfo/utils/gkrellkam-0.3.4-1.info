Description: Gkrellm plugin - Webcam viewer
DescDetail: <<
Gkrellkam is a plugin to GKrellM that displays thumbnails of
periodically updated images (such as webcams.)
Each panel can be associated with an image URL, a local image filename, a
list of image filenames and URLs, or a script that will be called to get
a fresh image. The images can be nearly any format or size. GKrellKam
will make them small enough to fit in the panel, and after N seconds, it
will get check its source again.
GKrellKam can launch an image viewer to show you the unscaled version of
the current image when you click on the panel. If you right-click, it
will trigger an immediate update. GKrellKam is very event-driven so it
uses up as little CPU time as possible.
