Description: Tangram (puzzle) game using GTK+
DescDetail: <<
	The Tangram is a Chinese puzzle where the player has to arrange a
	 set of pieces to match a given shape. All the pieces must be used 
	and should not be laid on top of one another. The pieces are five 
	triangles, a square and a parallelogram. gtans contains more than 380 
	figures to play with. It uses the mouse to control pieces. gtans is 
	highly customizable using the interface.
