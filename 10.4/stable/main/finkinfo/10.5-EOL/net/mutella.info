 Mutella is a command-line gnutella client that supports such things as

work fine), passive search (all query-reply packets are checked against

search for alternative locations when download fails to start immediately
and auto-get function for broken downloads.

commands just type 'help'. Type 'help <command>' for more specific info on
a particular command.
