Description: Command line SID (C64 audio file format) player
DescDetail: <<
Command line SID (C64 audio file format) player
<<
DescPort: <<
This was ported to use libao, which uses CoreAudio.  The libao
port to OS X only supports 44.1kHz 16bit 2 channel audio, so
this port of sidplay defaults to using those specifications.
Also, CoreAudio did not like the small buffer size that sidplay
defaulted to using, so the port also bumps up the buffer size
that sidplay uses.  If you change any of these settings, sidplay
will likely not work on OS X.
