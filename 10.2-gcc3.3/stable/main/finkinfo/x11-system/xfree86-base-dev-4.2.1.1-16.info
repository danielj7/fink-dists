Depends: xfree86-base-shlibs (= %v-%r)
Provides: x11-dev, xft1-dev
Type: bundle
Description: Placeholder for X11 dev packages, version 4.2
DescPackaging: <<
 This is being provided as a separate package for now so that users are
 not forced to upgrade xfree86 unnecessarily.  Eventually this should be
 a splitoff of xfree86-base.

 This obsolete xfree86 package should not be moved to 10.3.
