Description: Printed Circuit Board design program

DescDetail: <<
PCB allows you to design printed circuit boards. You can use gnetlist (part of
the geda-gnetlist package) to create a netlist to ensure that your PCB matches
a schematic diagram created with gschem.

PCB can create Gerber output files (both RS-274D and RS274X) and Excellon drill
files that you can send to board vendors for manufacturing. You can also create
PostScript plots of the board for verification purposes, or to create your own
photolithography masks for etching.
<<

DescPort: <<
Things just got a lot easier now that PCB uses auto* tools instead of imake.
<<

DescPackaging: <<
Stroke support is included, but largely untested on OS X. You will probably
need a 3-button mouse for this.
