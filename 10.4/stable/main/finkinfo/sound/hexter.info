DescDetail: <<
Hexter is a software synthesizer that models the sound generation of a
Yamaha DX7 synthesizer. It can easily load most DX7 patch bank files,
accept patch editing commands via MIDI sys-ex messages (ALSA systems
only), and recreate the sound of the DX7 with greater accuracy than
any previous open-source emulation (that the author is aware of....)

hexter operates as a plugin for the Disposable Soft Synth Interface
(DSSI). DSSI is a plugin API for software instruments (soft synths)
with user interfaces, permitting them to be hosted in-process by audio
applications. More information on DSSI can be found on the DSSI main
page.

hexter is written by Sean Bolton, and copyright (c)2009 under the GNU
General Public License, version 2 or later. While this software is
'free' within the requirements of that license, I (Sean) would
appreciate any or all of the following should you find hexter useful:

an email stating where you're from and how you're using hexter, sent
to <musound /at/ jps /dot/ net>.  copies of or links to music you've
created with hexter.  any favorite patches you create for hexter, or
any patches that work on a real DX7 but not on hexter.  suggestions
for improving hexter.  hexter benefited greatly from previous
open-source efforts, most notably Juan Linietsky's rx-saturno, and
FluidSynth by Peter Hanappe, et al. See the AUTHORS file in the hexter
distribution for more details.
