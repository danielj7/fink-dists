DescDetail: <<
The digest package provides a function 'digest()' for the creation of 
hash digests of arbitrary R objects (using the md5, sha-1, sha-256 and 
crc32 algorithms) permitting easy comparison of R language objects, 
as well as a function 'hmac()' to create hash-based message 
authentication code. The md5 algorithm by Ron Rivest is specified in 
RFC 1321, the sha-1 and sha-256 algorithms are specified in FIPS-180-1 
and FIPS-180-2, and the crc32 algorithm is described in 
ftp://ftp.rocksoft.com/cliens/rocksoft/papers/crc_v3.txt. 
For md5, sha-1, sha-256 and aes, this package uses a small standalone 
implementations that were provided by Christophe Devine. 
For crc32, code from the zlib library is used. 
For sha-512, an implementation by Aaron D. Gifford is used. 
Please note that this package is not meant to be deployed for 
cryptographic purposes for which more comprehensive (and widely tested) 
libraries such as OpenSSL should be used.
