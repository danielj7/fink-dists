Description: Rexx programming and scripting language
DescDetail: <<
NetRexx is a programming and scripting language that can support your
need to get products to market easier, faster, and at lower costs.

NetRexx blends the clean, easy-to-learn syntax of Rexx with the
robustness and portability of the Java environment.  The result is a
language tuned for both scripting and application development, and
designed for both interpretation and compilation -- a truly
general-purpose language.

NetRexx is an effective alternative to the Java language, letting you
create applications and applets for the Java environment faster and
more easily than by programming in Java.

Being very system-independent, NetRexx offers the advantages of
portability to almost any operating system that supports the Java
1.1 toolkit and a compiler that includes the JVM.
