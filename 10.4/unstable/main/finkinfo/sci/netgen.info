 Description: Documented source code for NETGEN/NGSolve
<<
Description: 3D mesh generator and Finite Element solver 
DescDetail: <<
NETGEN/NGSolve is a complete 3d finite element package.

NETGEN is an automatic 3d tetrahedral mesh generator. 
It accepts input from constructive solid geometry (CSG) or 
boundary representation (BRep) from STL file format. 
The connection to a geometry kernel allows the handling of 
IGES and STEP files. NETGEN contains modules for mesh optimization 
and hierarchical mesh refinement. 

NGSolve is a general purpose 3D finite element solver. 
Version 1.x supports scalar (heat flow), elasticity and magnetic 
field problems. The package provides C++ source code such that 
more advanced problem solvers can be built around it. 
NGSolve performs adaptive mesh refinement, the matrix equations are 
solved by optimal order multigrid methods.

NETGEN/NGSolve was developed mainly by Joachim Schoeberl within project 
grants from the Austrian Science Fund FWF ( Special Research Project
"Numerical and Symbolic Scientific Computing",
Start Project "hp-FEM") at the Johannes Kepler University Linz.
Significant contributions were made by Johannes Gerstmayr
(STL geometry) and Robert Gaisbauer (OpenCascade interface).
<<
DescUsage: <<
 The binary is "ng". 
 Run it from a directory where you have write permission, it
 writes to a file ngs.ini in the current directory.

 Example geometries are found in /sw/lib/netgen/tutorials.
 Example pde files are in /sw/lib/netgen/ngsolve/pde_tutorial.
 The directory /sw/lib/netgen/ngsolve contains further documentation
  in html format in the doc folder.
 Documentation in pdf Format is in the file /sw/share/doc/netgen/ng4.pdf.

 If you install the netgen-doc splitoff, you have the complete source 
  code of ngsolve in /sw/lib/netgen/ngsolve with documentation in 
  the doc++ folder, 
  and /sw/share/doc/netgen-doc/notes.pdf contains notes of a course on
   "Scientific Computing ? Software Concepts for Solving
    Partial Differential Equations" by Joachim Schoeberl.

<<
DescPackaging: <<
 This version is compiled with g++-3.3, even in the 10.4 tree.  If it is
 ever updated to a more recent compiler, any packages which depend on
 this one must be updated at the same time.
<<
DescPort: <<
 This version uses -g -O2 as compiler flags to facilitate debugging.
 From the pde_tutorial examples I am getting segmentation faults at
 the end of the solution procedure. If you have an idea why this is 
 so, please write me. M.C.
