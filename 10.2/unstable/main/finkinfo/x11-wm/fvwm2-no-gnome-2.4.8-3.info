  DocFiles: README.fvwm-common COPYING
  Description: Common files for versions 1 and 2.xx of fvwm
  DescUsage: <<
   Must be used with either the fvwm or fvwm2 packages; has no
   independent role.

License: GPL
Description: X11 wind. man., large virtual desktop, v2, no gnome support
DescPort: <<
 Requires libstroke-0.5, NOT any earlier version. We include the 
 optional imlib and gtk+ libraries because it is impossible to turn them off 
 with a ./configure  parameter.
<<
DescUsage: <<
 The system default %p/etc/system.fvwm2rc can be customized
 from among the samples in %p/etc/sample.fvwm2rc/ or customizing as you
 wish.  This choice can be overridden on a per-user basis with a .fvwm2rc
 file in the user's home directory. To invoke the fvwm2 window manager,
 the user's .xinitrc file should end with "exec fvwm2".
 This version does not require that GNOME be installed, for those who
 are not using GNOME.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
 Compiles with Xpm, readline, and LibStroke support, but without 
 rplay or session management support.  No GNOME support in this version.
 Copies the sample .fvwm2rc  files into %p/etc/sample.fvwm2rc/.  The
 xpmroot binary and some man files have been moved to the fvwm-common
 package; there is also an optional fvwm-icons package which installs some
 icons.
