Description:  Timing analysis for perl programs
DescDetail: <<
The Devel::Profile package is a Perl code profiler.  This will collect
information on the execution time of a Perl script and of the subs in
that script.  This information can be used to determine which subrou-
tines are using the most time and which subroutines are being called
most often.
