DescDetail: <<
 This package was inspired by the Big Brother Database package available for
 various Emacs mailers. It provides a command-line interface to various
 address books, and is designed to work with mutt's external query feature.
<<
DescUsage: <<
 lbdb depends on a number of external tools for some of the more obscure
 plugins. You'll have to install them separately if you want to use them.
