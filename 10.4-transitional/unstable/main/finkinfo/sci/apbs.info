DescDetail: <<
APBS is a software package for the numerical solution of the 
Poisson-Boltzmann equation, a popular continuum model for describing 
electrostatic interactions between molecular solutes over a wide range 
of length scales. Fink's pymol package is pre-configured to permit
apbs to be used as a plug-in.
.
The software is released under the GPL, but the author requests that you
register your use with him to aid him in obtaining funding to continue to
develop the code.  Most electrostatics software is payware, so please help
him continue to support this free software. You can do so at this URL:
