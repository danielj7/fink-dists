DescDetail: <<
	Each NCO operator (e.g., ncks) takes netCDF or HDF input file(s),
	performs an operation (e.g., averaging, hyperslabbing, or renaming),
	and outputs a processed netCDF file. Although most users of
	netCDF and HDF data are involved in scientific research,
	these data formats, and thus NCO, are generic and
	are equally useful in fields like finance.
	
	This version is OPeNDAP/DODS enabled, so it can be given
	URLs to read remote datasets as if they were local netCDF files.

	It uses Fink's netcdf-c7 package (upstream netCDF4.2+).
<<
DescPackaging: <<
Upstream has discontinued using libnc-dap, so have "nco" built against
netcdf be the new hotness, and merge nco-netcdf into it on update.

Build will give an error message if a prior version of the package is installed.
This gets ignored, however.
<<
DescPort: <<
Patch out an -lnco that tends to link to a library in a 
previously installed version of the package.

Upstream claims OS X doesn't understand shared libs; perhaps it's
upstream who doesn't understand. :-)

Even though this is a new release, the configure test for whether or not to
use flat namespace doesn't acknowledge 10.10 or later.
