Description: Powerful net sniffer (with OpenSSL)
DescDetail: <<
Ettercap is a multi-functional packet sniffer/interceptor/logger that
works on switched LANs. It allows the active and passive dissection of
numerous protocols, including ciphered ones, such as SSH1, and includes
features for network and host analysis. Four modes are available: IP
Based, MAC Address Based, ARP Based, and PublicARP Based.
This version does have OpenSSL support. For a version without OpenSSL,
see the 'ettercap' package.
<<
DescUsage: <<
Ettercap must be run as root, either through "sudo" or "su -".
The terminal window must be of the size 25 x 80, which it is not by default.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
ConfigureParams places manpages in proper directories, enables ncurses 
interface and disables use of openssl.
Patch modifies the plugin dir in Makefile.in files.
InstallScript moves configuration files into own directory under PREFIX/etc, 
and creates symlinks to the previous directory.
This version was updated by Masseboeuf Mathieu <math.m@promac.org>.
<<
DescPort: <<
Patch modifies Makefile.in file to add include directory.
Patch modifies the plugin function prefix which is no more _, fix some resolv lib issues and add some missing lib linking (lresolv)
