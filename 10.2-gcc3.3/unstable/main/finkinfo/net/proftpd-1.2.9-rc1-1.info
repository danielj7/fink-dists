Description: Incredibly configurable and secure FTP daemon
DescDetail: <<
  ProFTPD is a proven, high-performance, scalable FTP server written from
  scratch, with a focus toward simplicity, security, and ease of configuration.
  Naturally, ProFTPD powers some of the largest sites on the Internet. It
  features a very Apache-like configuration syntax, modules, and a highly
  customizable server infrastructure, including support for multiple 'virtual'
  FTP servers, anonymous FTP, and permission-based directory visibility.
