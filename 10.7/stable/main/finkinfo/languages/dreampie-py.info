Version: 1.1.1
Revision: 1
Type: python (2.7)
Description: The Python shell you've always dreamed about
DescDetail: <<
DreamPie was designed from the ground up to bring you a great interactive
Python experience:

DreamPie features a new concept for an interactive shell: the window is
divided into the history box, which lets you view previous commands and
their output, and the code box, where you write your code. This allows you
to edit any amount of code, just like in your favorite editor, and execute
it when it's ready. You can also copy code from anywhere, edit it and run
it instantly.

The Copy code only command will copy the code you want to keep, so you can
save it in a file. The code is already formatted nicely with a four-space
indentation.

Features automatic completion of attributes and file names.

Automatically displays function arguments and documentation.

Keeps your recent results in the result history, for later user.

Can automatically fold long outputs, so you can concentrate on what's
important.

Lets you save the history of the session as an HTML file, for future
reference. You can then load the history file into DreamPie, and quickly
redo previous commands.

Supports interactive plotting with matplotlib. (You have to set
"interactive: True" in the matplotlibrc file for this to work.)

Supports Python 2.5, Python 2.6, Jython 2.5, IronPython 2.6 and Python 3.1.

Works on Windows, Linux and Mac.

Extremely fast and responsive.
