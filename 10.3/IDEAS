- decide on setting MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET to 10.3 or not

- all pkgs that need a depend on essential pkgs should list that depend

- all pkgs that depend on ncurses will need a versioned dep as this version
  is bin incompat

- Need to discuss and implement an upgrade scheme

- Need to deal with prebinding in upgrade scheme

- Need to discuss how to handle freetype; 10.3 is the best opportunity
  to fix it.  There are 2 major possibilities:

  1. Fix every single package to always link against Fink's freetype, no
  matter what.  This still has the possibility of causing problems with
  things that link against X11's freetype outside of Fink's tree, but we
  really don't have control over that.

  2. Remove freetype2 and have only a freetype2-shlibs package for
  upgrade compatibility, and then link everything in 10.3 against X11's
  libfreetype, no matter what.  This also means that the bindist has to
  always be built against the same X11 and/or the oldest (4.2.x) X11.
