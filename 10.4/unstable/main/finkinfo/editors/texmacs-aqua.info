Description: TeX-based WYSIWYG editor
DescDetail: <<
 GNU TeXmacs is a free scientific text editor, which was both inspired
 by TeX and GNU Emacs. The editor allows you to write structured
 documents via a wysiwyg (what-you-see-is-what-you-get) and user
 friendly interface. New styles may be created by the user. The program
 implements high-quality typesetting algorithms and TeX fonts, which
 help you to produce professionally looking documents.

 The high typesetting quality still goes through for automatically
 generated formulas, which makes TeXmacs suitable as an interface for
 computer algebra systems. TeXmacs also supports the Guile/Scheme
 extension language, so that you may customize the interface and write
 your own extensions to the editor.
<<
DescUsage:<<
 There exist now 3 different Fink packages for TeXmacs,
 corresponding to different graphics libraries:

 1. The "texmacs" package uses X11 graphics.
    This is the traditional interface,
    and this is the most mature and most stable among the 3 packages.
 2. The "texmcs-qt" package uses the qt4-mac graphics library.
    This has a more Mac-like look and feel, but this version has still
    some bugs.
 3. The "texmacs-aqua" package uses the Mac-native cocoa library.
    This is a standard Mac app, to be found in
    /Applications/Fink/, but it is still very rough around the edges.

 TeXmacs provides a unified GUI for clisp, macaulay2, maxima, octave,
 pari-gp, scilab if they are installed. No configuration necessary,
 they are auto-detected at program startup.

 The octave plugin is currently broken.

 Ghostscript is needed for importing images. Since even the TeXmacs
 documentation contains images, ghostscript is strongly recommended.

 For importing non-postscript images, the netpbm package is recommended.
