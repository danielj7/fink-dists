Description: Python module to access R functions
DescDetail: <<
 RPy is a very simple, yet robust, interface to the R Programming Language.
 It can manage all kinds of R objects and can execute arbitrary R functions
 (including the graphic functions). All the errors from the R language are 
 converted to Python exceptions. 
<<
DescPort: <<
 RPy.h header file brought in through patch, since it is clobbered by
 apparently extraneous file rpy.h when tarball is expanded on HFS+.
