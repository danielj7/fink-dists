The osh project provides two ports of the original /bin/sh from Sixth Edition
(V6) UNIX (circa 1975). J.A. Neitzel develops and maintains this project.

Osh(1) is an enhanced, backward-compatible port of the Sixth Edition Thompson
shell. Sh6(1) is an unenhanced port of the shell, and glob6(1) is a port of its
global command. Together, sh6 and glob6 provide a user interface which is
backward compatible with that provided by the Sixth Edition Thompson shell and
global command, but without the obvious enhancements found in osh.

The original Thompson shell was principally written by Ken Thompson of Bell
Labs.

Additionally, this project includes the following shell utilities:

if(1) - conditional command (ported from Sixth Edition UNIX) goto(1) - transfer
command (ported from Sixth Edition UNIX) fd2(1) - redirect from/to file
