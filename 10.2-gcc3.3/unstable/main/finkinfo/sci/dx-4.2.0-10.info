Description: Open Visualization Data Explorer
DescDetail: <<
Open Visualization Data Explorer is a full visualization environment that 
gives users the ability to apply advanced visualization and analysis
techniques to their data. These techniques can be applied to help users 
gain new insights into data from applications in a wide variety of fields
including science, engineering, medicine and business. Data Explorer
provides a full set of tools for manipulating, transforming, processing, 
realizing, rendering and animating data and allow for visualization and 
analysis methods based on points, lines, areas, volumes, images or geometric
primitives in any combination. Data Explorer is discipline-independent and
easily adapts to new applications and data. The integrated object-oriented
graphical user interface is intuitive to learn and easy to use.

DescPort: <<
Incompatible with fink's autoconf-2.53. Uses Apple's autoconf-2.52 instead.
Now that macosx has a trunc(double) function defined in <math.h>, 
redinition in <dx/arch.h> obsolete. Commented out line.
The original program installed itself in %p/dx, which is against fink policy.
Various makefile.am  were modified so that fink installed the bulk of the
program in %p/share/dx, while installing binaries, includes, manfiles, etc.
 in %p/bin, %p/include, %p/share/man etc. Using %p/lib breaks things, so I've 
left the "libraries"  in %/p/share/dx/lib/. 
CPP is now explicitly defined-- autoconf2.52 drops the all important 
--no-precomp-cpp flag, leading to errors in the build process.
Disables java dx. 
Disables cdf so it doesn't try to link with the cdf package I'm trying to 
debug
Fixed mklib script to properly install lib_macos libraries. (libDX.a, etc)
