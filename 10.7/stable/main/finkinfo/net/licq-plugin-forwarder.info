DescDetail: <<
This program is an forwarder.  It is a plugin for the Licq
daemon and can run either on it's own on along with an interface plugin
(such as the Qt-gui or console plugins).
Any events (messages, urls...) received while the plugin is enabled will
be forwarded either via standard SMTP to a given email account or via Licq
to a user.
<<
DescUsage: <<
Type licq -h for commandline help.

Loading and running the plugin is simply a matter of adding a "-p 
forwarder" to your Licq command line arguments.  Remember that if any 
plugins are loaded from the command line then all plugins must be 
specified.  In other words if you are using the qt4-gui plugin and also 
wish to start the forwarder plugin, run:
licq [options] -p qt4-gui -p forwarder -- [ qt4-gui opt ] -- [ forwarder opt ]

The forwarder plugin starts in an inactive state, and must be turned on 
from the plugin interface to start forwarding messages. In this manner it 
can be turned on and off without having to exit Licq. Optionally, or if 
the only plugin desired is the forwarder, it can be started enabled by 
using the "-e" parameter on the command line. Remember that all plugin 
options must come after a "--" on the command line. The "-l <status>" 
option will tell the plugin to automatically log on in the given status at 
startup.  This is equivalent (and uses the same status strings as) the 
fifo command "status" (see the FAQ under FIFO).

For example, to start Licq using only the forwarder and have it start in
enabled mode and logon, run:
licq -f -p forwarder -- -e -l online

The "-f" option to Licq tells it to fork into the background, thus running 
Licq in true daemon mode.  This is optional in any case. Another useful 
option in this case is "-o <filename>" which will redirect the Licq log 
messages to a file (or device, such as /dev/tty9).

The plugin uses a small configuration file (~/.licq/licq_forwarder.conf) 
which must be set up by hand.  A sample is included at

%p/share/doc/licq-plugin-forwarder/examples/licq_forwarder.conf

, and includes help on the various settings.
