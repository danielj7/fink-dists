Description: C++ wrapper for the PCRE library
DescDetail: <<
  PCRE++ is a C++ wrapper-class for the great library PCRE. (Perl Compatible
  Regular Expressions), which is available on http://www.pcre.org/ by
  Philip Hazel. 

  This class allows you to use perl alike regular expressions in your C++
  applications. You can use it to search in strings, to split strings into
  parts using expressions or to search and replace a part of a string with
  another part.

Patch: %f.patch
DescPackaging: <<
  The patch is necessary for two things:
    1) to make the doc files go into share/doc
    2) to force configure to choose g++ instead of c++ for the compiler.
       g++ is required because otherwise the pcre++ shared library is
       incorrectly linked against the STL, i.e. applications that link
       dynamically against pcre++ refuse to run because of undefined
       symbols.
