DescDetail: <<
The Computer Music Toolkit (CMT) is a collection of LADSPA plugins
for use with software synthesis and recording packages on Linux.
See the license before use.

The CMT was initially designed and developed by Richard W.E. Furse
(who was also the principal designer of the LADSPA standard) and
further plugins have been provided by by Jezar, David Bartold and
Nathaniel Virgo.  If you are a programmer or can write
documentation and would like to help out, please feel free to
