Description: Graph partitioning and matrix ordering
DescDetail: <<
METIS is a set of serial programs for partitioning graphs, partitioning 
finite element meshes, and producing fill reducing orderings for sparse 
matrices. The algorithms implemented in METIS are based on the multilevel 
recursive-bisection, multilevel k-way, and multi-constraint partitioning 
schemes developed in the Karypis Lab at the University of Minnesota.

METIS's key features are the following:

Provides high quality partitions!
Experiments on a large number of graphs arising in various domains including
finite element methods, linear programming, VLSI, and transportation show that
METIS produces partitions that are consistently better than those produced by
other widely used algorithms. The partitions produced by METIS are 
consistently 10% to 50% better than those produced by spectral partitioning 
algorithms.

It is extremely fast!
Experiments on a wide range of graphs has shown that METIS is one to two
orders of magnitude faster than other widely used partitioning algorithms. 
Graphs with over 1,000,000 vertices can be partitioned in 256 parts in a few
seconds on current generation workstations and PCs.

Produces low fill orderings!
The fill-reducing orderings produced by METIS are significantly better than
those produced by other widely used algorithms including multiple minimum 
degree. For many classes of problems arising in scientific computations and
linear programming, METIS is able to reduce the storage and computational 
requirements of sparse matrix factorization, by up to an order of magnitude. 
Moreover, unlike multiple minimum degree, the elimination trees produced by 
METIS are suitable for parallel direct factorization. Furthermore, METIS is 
able to compute these orderings very fast. Matrices with over 200,000 rows can
be reordered in just a few seconds on current generation workstations and PCs.
