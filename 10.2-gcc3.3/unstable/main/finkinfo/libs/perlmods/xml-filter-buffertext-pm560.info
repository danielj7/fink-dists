Description: Perl SAX Filter to guarantee characters in one event
DescDetail: <<
This is a very simple filter. One common cause of grief (and programmer error)
is that XML parsers aren't required to provide character events in one chunk.
They can, but are not forced to, and most don't. This filter does the trivial
but oft-repeated task of putting all characters into a single event.
