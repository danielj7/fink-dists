Description: Speech compression library
DescDetail: <<
Contains runtime shared libraries for libgsm, an implementation of the
European GSM 06.10 provisional standard for full-rate speech
transcoding, prI-ETS 300 036, which uses RPE/LTP (residual pulse
excitation/long term prediction) coding at 13 kbit/s.

GSM 06.10 compresses frames of 160 13-bit samples (8 kHz sampling rate,
i.e. a frame rate of 50 Hz) into 260 bits; for compatibility with
typical UNIX applications, our implementation turns frames of 160 16-bit
linear samples into 33-byte frames (1650 Bytes/s). The quality of the
algorithm is good enough for reliable speaker recognition; even music
often survives transcoding in recognizable form (given the bandwidth
limitations of 8 kHz sampling rate).

The interfaces offered are a front end modelled after compress(1), and a
library API. Compression and decompression run faster than realtime on
most SPARCstations. The implementation has been verified against the
ETSI standard test patterns.

DescPackaging: <<
Patches the Makefile to set the compiler and the man path and corrects 
the install rules to create directories before installing into them..

dmacks: Patched Makefile to avoid warnings about deleting files that
don't exist (would need if installing into an already-populated %d).

nieder: moved bin (and man1) to gsm-bin

dmacks: converted to shared library (similar to Debian's packaging)
