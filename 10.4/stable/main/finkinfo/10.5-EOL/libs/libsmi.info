Description: Library to Access SMI MIB Information
DescDetail: <<
The core of the libsmi distribution is a library that allows
management applications to access SMI MIB module definitions. On
top of this library, there are tools to check, analyze dump, convert,
and compare MIB definitions. Finally, the distribution contains a
steadily maintained and revised archive of all IETF and IANA
maintained standard MIB and PIB modules.

The library is internally divided into two layers. The upper layers
represent the API to applications that make use of libsmi.
Furthermore, the upper layer holds the MIB information in common
internal data structures. The lower layer contains the drivers
that implement the access to persistent MIB module repositories.
Currently drivers for SMIv1/v2 MIB module files and for SPPI PIB
module files exist. A driver for an early draft of SMIng is also
present.

  Make sure to get Apple's commands in order to minimize external deps.

  sysconfdir is not fully expanded by default, so hard-code it.

  Redo auto* to get lots of modern things (-L usage, twolevel, etc)
