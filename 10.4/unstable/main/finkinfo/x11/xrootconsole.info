Description: Live logs on background. IS rootless bg
DescDetail: <<
xrootconsole is a small utility to write any log file of your choice live
to anywhere on your root window with options for color and placement all
documented in the man file or with the --help option.

In rootless XDarwin, the area it's set to cover becomes an area that acts 
as the root window.  Convenient for wm's not hacked to deal with no root 
window.

Enjoy!
