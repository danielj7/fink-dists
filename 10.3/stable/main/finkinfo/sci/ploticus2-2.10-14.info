    A simple C-callable API that allows Ploticus to be embedded in other applications, and facilitates interfaces to Perl, PHP, Python, etc.

    Note that there is no header file for this library.

    Changes to Makefile_api:

    (Un)commented the Mac OS X section.

    Copied the XLIBS and ADDLIBS make variables from the main Makefile in order to build a dynamic shared library. Added an appropriate cc command to actually build the library.

    Patched all locations that are somewhere in the fink tree, as noted for the main package.

    Set FLAGS = -fno-common, GDLEVEL = -DGD18, GDOBJ =, GDHEADERS = -I@PREFIX@/include, GDFREETYPE = -DGDFREETYPE.

    Enabled all output options and locale support.

    The main package isn't required, but it is recommended because it includes the prefabs directory and more importantly, the full ploticus documentation :) The API documentation and a usage example are included in the ploticus2-dev splitoff.

    Note that there is no header file for this API.

## Additional data
##
DescDetail: <<
  Ploticus is free GPL software that generates plots and graphs from data. The primary components are the ploticus program and libploticus C language API. Create basic plots quickly from the command line using prefabs, or write customized scripts for maximum power and flexibility. You can invoke it manually, automatically from other programs, or directly as a CGI. Produce PNG, SVG or JPEG (with optional click map) for web pages, and for import into documents and slide presentations. PostScript and EPS are supported for paper reports and posters; graphs may also be viewed interactively on X11 displays. Ploticus accepts tabular ascii data input. Numerics, alphanumeric categories, dates and times (in a variety of notations) can be plotted directly. You can also compute frequency distributions, correlation coefficients, curves, regression lines, medians, quartiles, etc. Ploticus is available for a number of platforms.

  Full HTML documentation and examples are included with the package.

  Changes to Makefile:

  (Un)commented the appropriate section (the section for Linux/FreeBSD). We're compiling with all features switched on, so set the ploticus target to plgd18.

  Patched all locations that are somewhere in the fink tree. This defaults to %p and is passed in from the compile script. (Thanks to Jeff Whitaker for pointing this out.)

  Added -L@PREFIX@/lib to ADDLIBS (also see libfreetype comment below) and -I@PREFIX@/include to GD18H.

  Set FLAGS = -dynamic to force use of dynamic shared libraries rather than static ones.

  Set PL = ploticus (defines the name of the binary) to avoid a conflict with pre-existing /usr/bin/pl.

  The ploticus prefabs directory is hardcoded as %p/share/%n/prefabs (passed in from the compile script via the PREFABS_DIR make variable).

  Ploticus is linked with libX11, so /usr/X11R6/lib has to be in the library path. This causes minor problems because ld ends up finding two copies of libfreetype: one installed by Fink (as required in the package dependencies), and one that's included with XFree86. This results in link warnings about multiply-defined symbols. Fixed by adding -dylib_file /usr/X11R6/lib/libfreetype.6.dylib:@PREFIX@/lib/libfreetype.6.dylib to the GD18LIBS makefile variable to force ld to link to /sw/lib/libfreetype.

  Enabled locale support.

DescPackaging: <<
  Patches the makefiles to compile properly under Darwin. Also applies any late patches from the Ploticus author before compiling. (Current patches: Makefile_api, proc_processdata.c, proc_axis.c.)

  A slight peculiarity of the compile process: we have to do a "make -f Makefile_api clean" before actually making the shared libraries. This is because the author appears to have accidentally left a couple of ELF object files in the source directory. Doing the make clean first disposes of these safely, as they of course aren't overwritten by the normal make process.

  Note that there are no header files for the ploticus API shared libary. That's why the package doesn't install any :) and why it doesn't need a BuildDependsOnly line. Also, the main package is totally independent of the -shlibs package, which is why it doesn't depend on it as you might normally expect.

  Although the full documentation is a separate download, it is included in this package because Ploticus is somewhat non-intuitive. The full documentation comes with a comprehensive gallery of fully-documented examples.

  I've patched the documentation to change most references to "pl" (the original binary name) to "ploticus". I've also removed most references to GIF since this build doesn't support pseudo-GIF creation (not for any political reasons --- the Makefile simply doesn't include it when you enable all the other formats). Obviously, it would be improper to change any references that are are historical in nature, refer to a package for another operating system or are in a feedback email, so I've left these as they are. I also fixed the odd typo that I noticed :) The upshot of all this is that the Fink package documentation differs somewhat from the official documentation provided at the ploticus web site. It also makes for a big patch (>200KB), but I think it's justified, and isn't unheard of.

  Note: A precompiled Mac OS X binary is available from the Ploticus web site. It doesn't support X11; the binary built by this package does.
