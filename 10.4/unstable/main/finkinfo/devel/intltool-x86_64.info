Description: Internationalize various kinds of data files
DescDetail: <<
Automatically extracts translatable strings from oaf, glade, bonobo
ui, nautilus theme and other files into the po files.

Automatically merges translations from po files back into .oaf files
(encoding to be 7-bit clean). Also merges into other kinds of files.

This is the older major-version release, which apparently has some
compatibility problems vs the newer 0.40 series. Use "intltool40" if
you need the newer version for now.
<<
DescPort: <<
	Use Dep:system-perlXXX,xml-parser-pmXXX to correspond to what Apple
	ships as /usr/bin/perl. Unfortunately ./configure doesn't allow PERL
	to be versioned (perlX.X.X), so that's the best we can figure to try
	to force things to be self-consistent and likely-to-be-present with
	a minimum of additional packages needed.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
	The ac_cv_path_INTLTOOL_PERL shell variable is automatically set to
	the system perl interpretter, so any package that uses intltool and
	has ./configure checks for "perl" and "XML::Parser" will get the
	correct perl interpretter that is used by intltool and thus test for
	the matched perl version of xml-parser-pmXXX that is needed, even if
	there are other perl interpretters in PATH.
