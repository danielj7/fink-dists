DescPackaging: <<
This package:
License is listed as GPL3+/Modified BSD, and the validator currently doesn't
know how to handle that.

Hideous Distribution tagging is so that we can keep a *single* .info file in the
10.7 tree that covers all octversions for 10.7/10.8, but keeps only 3.6.4+ for 10.9.  
This is by design.  Don't touch this file without my permission.

Common for all octave-forge packages:
Preinst and postinst scripts are dynamically set up via 
%p/share/fink-octave-scripts/octave-forge-patch.sh because Octave's package manager 
can't cope with non-literal arguments.

The Type: forge (pkgname) is used to minimize what needs to be changed when
using this .info file as a template.
