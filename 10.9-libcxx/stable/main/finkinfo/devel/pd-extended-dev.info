Description: Bundle of libraries for building Pd-extended
DescDetail: <<
This package is a meta package for setting up the build environment
for Pd-extended.  Pd-extended builds against many libraries from Fink
and also conflicts with a few.  This package is an easy way to install
all of the required packages, and make sure that the conflicting
packages remain uninstalled.
