DescDetail: <<
RubyOSA is a bridge that connects Ruby to the Apple Event Manager
infrastructure.  In big words, it allows you to do in Ruby what
you could do in AppleScript.

It works by retrieving the scriptable definition of a given
application and populating a new namespace with classes, methods,
constants, enumerations, and all other elements described by the
terminology.  More specifically, most Mac OS X applications are
scriptable, and they define their scriptable interface in an XML
format.  RubyOSA parses this file and creates the Ruby API on
the fly.  This API will do the necessary AppleEvent work
transparently for you (building and sending events).
