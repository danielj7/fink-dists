Description: Convert XML| HTML <-> a line-oriented format
DescDetail: <<
These tools are used to convert XML, CSV, and HTML to and from a line-oriented 
format more amenable to processing by classic Unix pipeline processing tools, 
like grep, sed, awk, cut, shell scripts, and so forth.
Documentation is available at http://ofb.net/~egnor/xml2/ref, and there are 
illustrative examples at http://ofb.net/~egnor/xml2/examples .
