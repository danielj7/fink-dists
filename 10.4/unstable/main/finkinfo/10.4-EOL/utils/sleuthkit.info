Description: Tools for forensics analysis
DescDetail: <<
  The Sleuth Kit (previously known as TASK) is a collection of UNIX-based
  command line file and volume system forensic analysis tools. The file
  system tools allow you to examine file systems of a suspect computer in a
  non-intrusive fashion.
  Because the tools do not rely on the operating system to process the file
  systems, deleted and hidden content is shown.
  The volume system (media management) tools allow you to examine the layout
  of disks and other media.
  The Sleuth Kit supports DOS partitions, BSD partitions (disk labels),
  Mac partitions, Sun slices (Volume Table of Contents), and GPT disks.
  With these tools, you can identify where partitions are located and extract
  them so that they can be analyzed with file system analysis tools.
