Description: MP3::Info, for getting info out of and into MP3 files
DescDetail: <<
  This is MP3::Info, for getting info out of and into MP3 files.

  This release has some more bugfixes for extracting ID3v2 tags,
  including fixes for ID3v2.2.0, basic support for ID3v2.4.0, and
  support for Unicode tags.  See the documentation for more information.

  A wrapper module is included so scripts calling MPEG::MP3Info (the
  old name) will still work.
