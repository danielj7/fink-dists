Description: Another Window Manager not unlike blackbox

DescDetail: <<
Fluxbox is yet another windowmanager for X.

It's based on the Blackbox 0.61.1 code. Fluxbox looks like 
blackbox and handles styles, colors, window placement and 
similar thing exactly like blackbox (100% theme/style 
compability).

Features->
    * Configurable window tabs.
    * Iconbar (for minimized/iconified windows)
    * Wheel scroll changes workspace
    * Configurable titlebar (placement of buttons, new buttons etc)
    * KDE support
    * New native integrated keygrabber (supports emacs like keychains)
    * Maximize over slit option
    * Partial GNOME support
