Description: More helpful patch
DescDetail: <<
mpatch applies diffs and is generally similar to patch, but it can
help resolve a number of common causes of patch rejects.

mpatch also supports the git patch extensions.  Outside of an SCM,
these are mostly useful to preserve permissions changes in a patch.

Reject merging works by using the entire hunk as a source of context,
and being more relaxed about finding extra lines in the source file,
or not finding every line from the hunk.
