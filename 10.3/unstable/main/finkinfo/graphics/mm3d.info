Description: 3D model editor
DescDetail: <<
Misfit Model 3D is an OpenGL-based 3D model editor that works with
triangle-based models. It supports multi-level undo, skeletal
animations, simple texturing, scripting, command-line batch
processing, and a plugin system for adding new model and image
filters. Complete online help is included. It is designed to be easy
to use and easy to extend with plugins and scripts.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
	Force non-detection of OS X to get x11 instead of Aqua graphics

	Patch ./configure to allow passing of external QT flags

	Linking to mesa/mesa-shlibs's GL instead of x11's causes
	linkage to freeglut and core dumping
