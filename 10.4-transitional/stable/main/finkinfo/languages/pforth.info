Description: Portable ANS-like Forth written in ANSI 'C'
DescDetail: <<
PForth is an ANSI style Forth designed to be portable across many
platforms.  The 'P' in pForth stands for "Portable". PForth is based
on a Forth kernel written in ANSI standard 'C'.

PForth has been designed with portability as the primary design
goal. As a result, pForth avoids any fancy UNIX calls. pForth also
avoids using any clever and original ways of constructing the Forth
dictionary. It just compiles its kernel from ANSI compatible 'C' code
then loads ANS compatible Forth code to build the dictionary. Very
boring but very likely to work on almost any platform.

The pForth software code is dedicated to the public domain, and any
third party may reproduce, distribute and modify the pForth software
code or any derivative works thereof without any compensation or
license. The pForth software code is provided on an "as is" basis
without any warranty of any kind, including, without limitation, the
implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular
purpose and their equivalents under the laws of any jurisdiction.
