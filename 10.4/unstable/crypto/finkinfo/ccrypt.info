# Additional Info
DescDetail: <<
ccrypt is a utility for encrypting and decrypting files and streams. It
was designed as a replacement for the standard unix crypt utility, which
is notorious for using a very weak encryption algorithm. ccrypt is based
on the Rijndael cipher, which is the U.S. government's chosen candidate
for the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES, see http://www.nist.gov/aes).
This cipher is believed to provide very strong security.

Unlike unix crypt, the algorithm provided by ccrypt is not symmetric,
i.e., one must specify whether to encrypt or decrypt. The most common
way to invoke ccrypt is via the commands ccencrypt and ccdecrypt. There
is also a ccat command for decrypting a file directly to the terminal,
thus reducing the likelihood of leaving temporary plaintext files
around. In addition, there is a compatibility mode for decrypting legacy
unix crypt files. An emacs mode is also supplied for editing encrypted
text files.

Encryption and decryption depends on a keyword (or key phrase) supplied
by the user. By default, the user is prompted to enter a keyword from
the terminal. Keywords can consist of any number of characters, and all
characters are significant (although ccrypt internally hashes the key to
256 bits). Longer keywords provide better security than short ones,
since they are less likely to be discovered by exhaustive search.

For a detailed description of the encryption algorithm used by ccrypt,
see the man page.
