Description: TNEF Stream Reader
DescDetail: <<
ytnef is a program to decode TNEF streams (winmail.dat). Unlike other similar 
programs, it can also decode meeting requests and create VCal entries for easy 
import. It can also create vCard entries from contact cards and vTodo entries 
from task entries. It also has a Perl script that can be used in procmail 
recipes to automatically reformat incoming mail appropriately.
