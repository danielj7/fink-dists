Description: Perl Module to add Date::Manip 
DescDetail: <<
  This is a set of routines designed to make any common date/time
  manipulation easy to do.  Operations such as comparing two times,
  calculating a time a given amount of time from another, or parsing
  international times are all easily done.  From the very beginning, the main
  focus of Date::Manip has been to be able to do ANY desired date/time
  operation easily, not necessarily quickly.  Also, it is definitely oriented
  towards the type of operations we (as people) tend to think of rather than
  those operations used routinely by computers.  There are other modules that
  can do a subset of the operations available in Date::Manip much quicker
  than those presented here.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
  Disable tests per INSTALL:
    A few of the tests may fail.  Some will fail if they are run on a
    very slow computer (it will compare two different times that were
    supposed to be the same but aren't because a measurable amount of
    time passed between determining the time in two different ways).
