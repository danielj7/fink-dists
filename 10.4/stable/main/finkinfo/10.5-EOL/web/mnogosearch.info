Description: Search Engine
DescDetail: <<
mnogosearch is a full-featured search engine software for intranet and
internet servers. UdmSearch is a free software covered by the GNU
General Public License.

mnogosearch has a number of unique features, which makes it appropriate
for a wide range of applications from searches within your site to
specialized search systems such as cooking recipes or newspaper
searches, ftp archive searches, news articles searches, etc.
<<
DescUsage: <<
mnogosearch consists of two parts. The first is an indexing mechanism
(indexer). The purpose of the indexer is to walk through HTTP, FTP, NEWS
servers or local files, recursively grabbing all the documents and
storing meta-data about those documents in an SQL database in a smart
and efficient manner.

After every document is referenced by its corresponding URL, meta-data,
collected by the indexer is used later in the search process. The search
is performed via Web interface. C CGI, PHP3 and Perl search front ends
are included.

<<
DescPort: <<
Doc and support files are mannually installed.

CVS directories removed at the end of installation, to comply with fink policy.

Uses UpdateConfigGuess/UpdateLibtool, which are still
newer than the files in the source package.

Libtool is further updated to not break on the output
of 'file' on a 64-bit dylib. Note that it still uses
-undefined dynamic_lookup.
