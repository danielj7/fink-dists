Description: Converts text files to PostScript
DescDetail: <<
Enscript converts text files to PostScript and spools gen-
erated PostScript output to the specified printer or
leaves it to file.  If no input files are given, enscript
processes standard input.  Enscript can be extended to
handle different output media and it has many options
which can be used to customize printouts.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
I created this package because the enscript 1.6.1 that ships
with Mac OS X (10.1) seems to be broken on all machines I could
check (6 different installations). More specifically, the states
program which enscript uses for pretty-printing was not able to
parse the supplied enscript.st file
This straighforward package works now as expected and therefore
also allows html-export.
<<
DescPort: <<
Natively supports Mac OSX.
