Description: Sophisticated command line based FTP client
DescDetail: <<
  lftp is a sophisticated command line based FTP client. It has a
  multithreaded design allowing you to issue and execute multiple
  commands simultaneosly or in the background. It also features
  mirroring capabilities and will reconnect and continue transfers
  in the event of a disconnection. Also, if you quit the program while
  transfers are still in progress, it will switch to nohup mode and
  finish the transfers in the background. HTTP protocol and FTP over
  HTTP proxy are supported. Version 2.3.0 includes HTTPS and FTP over
  SSL support.
