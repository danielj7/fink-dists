Description: Key binding handler for Blackbox
DescDetail: <<
In the Blackbox window manager version 0.60 and higher, a separate 
application is needed to handle key bindings. This is such a program.
<<
DescUsage: <<
To create new keybindings use the bbkeysConfigC utility, or add them
by hand to your ~/.bbkeysrc file. See the readme file at
<fink-root>/share/doc/bbkeys/README for example keybindings.

For no apparent reason, this program thinks it should have a window 
visible at all times. Use the -m argument to make it smaller and 
slightly more tolerable.
