DescDetail: <<
This package estimates factor analysis models using a genetic
algorithm, which permits a general mechanism for restricted
optimization with arbitrary restrictions that are chosen at
run time with the help of a GUI. Importantly, inequality
restrictions can be imposed on functions of multiple parameters,
which provides a new avenues for testing and generating theories
with factor analysis models. This package also includes an
entirely new estimator of the common factor analysis model
called semi-exploratory factor analysis, which is a general
alternative to exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis.
Finally, this package integrates a lot of other packages that
estimate sample covariance matrices and thus provides a lot of
alternatives to the traditional sample covariance calculation.
Note that you need to have the Gtk run time library installed
on your system to use this package; see the URL below for
detailed installation instructions. Most users would only need
to understand the first twenty-four pages of the PDF manual.
