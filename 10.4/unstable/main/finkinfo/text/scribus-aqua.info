Description: Layout program
DescDetail: << 
Scribus is a Layout program in the tradition of Corel Ventura[tm], Adobe
PageMaker[tm], QuarkXPress[tm] or Adobe InDesign[tm], except that it is
published under the GNU GPL.

Since its launch in the spring of 2001, Scribus 1.+ offers Linux and Unix
users a versatile and user friendly page layout application. Scribus 1.0 and
its recent development versions are being used in a number of ways; from
brochure design to newsletters and posters to technical
documentation. Scribus has the type of the features one would expect in a
sophisticated page layout application. You can do all the typical tasks like
precision placing and rotating of text and/or images on a page, specify
manual kerning of type and much more. With the release of Scribus 1.0, Linux
and Unix users now have one more high quality application for the desktop,
making it the premier choice for DTP on Linux or BSD with other platforms to
come.

Underneath the modern and user friendly interface, Scribus supports
professional publishing features, such as CMYK color and a simple color
management system to soft proof images destined for high quality color
printing, Other features include flexible PDF creation options, PDF Import,
Encapsulated Postscript import/export and creation of 4 color
separations. Scribus also supports via freetype Unicode text including right
to left scripts such as Arabic and Hebrew.

Graphic formats which can be placed in Scribus include Encapsulated Post
Script (eps), TIFF(Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG), Portable Network
Graphics (png) and XPixMap(xpm). Scribus now also handles any bit map file
type supported by QT3.
<<
DescUsage: <<
 This version does not need X11 for running. 
 It installs a double-clickable application (symbolic link) 
 "Scribus.app" in /Applications/Fink. 
 There are still problems with some graphical interface objects.

 This version contains extensive online help. 
 Additional up-to-date documentation is on the Scribus web site.

 Fonts:  Since X11 is not used, the X11 fonts are not automatically
   recognized. You have to tell Scribus where to find fonts.
 - Install the x-ghostscript-fonts or msttcorefonts or xfonts-intl 
   or applesystemfont packages. 
   (The gimp-sharefonts and similar packages work, too, 
   but these fonts are of rather bad quality)
 - Put lines like
     /Library/Fonts
     /System/Library/Fonts
     /sw/lib/X11/fonts/applettf
     /sw/lib/X11/fonts/msttf
   into your ~/.scribus/scribusfont13.rc file (create it if it doesn't exist)
   This will give you many (not all) of the Apple system fonts.
   If you use FontBook to create your own collections, put also
     ~/Library/Fonts
   into this file.

DescPort: <<
 This is a native Aqua version of Scribus. 
 A standalone version prepared by Andreas Vox can be downloaded
 from the web at http://aqua.scribus.net

 The app skeleton is taken from Scribus CVS, branch Release_1_3_3_3.
 It is not contained in the Release 1.3.3.3 source tarball.

 Uses fontconfig2-dev and freetype219 from Fink, not from X11,
 and qt3-mac-free as packaged in the qt3mac packaqge.
