Description: System for generating configure scripts
DescDetail: <<
GNU Autoconf is a package for generating configure scripts.
These scripts are present in a large number of free software packages
and are used to detect system features at compilation time.

This package installs Autoconf 2.13. There are newer versions
available, but there are some compatibility problems and some packages
require version 2.13. To get one of the new versions, install the
autoconf package instead.
<<
DescUsage: <<
This package buries its programs and data-files in %p/lib/autoconf2.13
to avoid colliding with the more modern autoconf packages.
