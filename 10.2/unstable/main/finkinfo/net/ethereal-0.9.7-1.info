Description: Powerful network protocol analyzer
DescDetail: <<
Ethereal is a free network protocol analyzer for Unix and Windows.
It allows you to examine data from a live network or from a capture
file on disk. You can interactively browse the capture data, viewing
summary and detail information for each packet. Ethereal has several
powerful features, including a rich display filter language and the
ability to view the reconstructed stream of a TCP session.

DescPackaging: <<
To prevent source URL problems once they update to a new version again,
this package uses CustomMirror.

DescPort: <<
Fix to configure so that ethereal correctly detects dlopen is available.
Also the usual libtool fix for building bundles.
