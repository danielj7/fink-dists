DescDetail: <<
PySignals is a signal dispatcher for Python, extracted from "django.dispatch" 
in the Django framework so it can be used in applications without requiring 
the entire Django framework to be installed.

PySignals is directly extracted from the Django framework, therefore the best 
place to get documentation is from the Django Signals Documentation.

The only difference is that all occurrences of django.dispatch should be 
replaced by pysignals.
