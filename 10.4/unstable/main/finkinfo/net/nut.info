Description: Network UPS Tools - core
DescDetail: <<
NUT is a client/server uninterruptible power supply (UPS) monitoring system
that permits the sharing of one (or more) UPS between several machines.  The
'server' monitors the UPS and notifies the 'clients' when the UPS is on
battery or has a low battery.

If you have a serial UPS, you will need a USB-to-serial converter and OS X
drivers for the converter. In this case, install the base "nut" package.

If your UPS connects via a USB cable, install the "nut-usb" package. This
covers most APC Back-UPS models, as well as MGE Ellipse, Comet, Nova,
Evolution, and Protection Center units. Some Belkin models may be supported.
Tripp Lite USB models that use usbhid-ups (especially ones with LCD in their
name) should work, but the tripplite_usb driver currently cannot open
entry-level Tripp Lite USB devices on Mac OS X.

If you have a MGE UPS with a Network Management Card that supports the XML/HTTP
protocol, then you will want the "nut-xml" package.

The "newhidups" driver was renamed "usbhid-ups" after the 2.0.5 release.

To graphically view the status of your UPSes, install the "nut-cgi" package.
<<

DescUsage:<<
You will need to read the documentation in %p/share/doc/%n/docs to learn how to
set up NUT to monitor your UPS and shut down your machine when the UPS battery
is low.

Note that some USB UPSes may already be supported by OS X, and the NUT drivers
may have trouble interoperating.

If you have any questions, please consult the nut-users list:

The nut-scanner binary (and its horde of dependencies) has not been packaged yet.
