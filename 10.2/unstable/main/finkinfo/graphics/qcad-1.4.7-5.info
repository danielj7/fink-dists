Description: Simple 2D CAD program.
DescDetail: <<
Qcad is a simple 2D CAD system that allows the user to create or modify 
drawings and then save them as DXF files. These files can then be used with 
other, more advanced, CAD systems, such as AutoCAD.
<<
DescUsage: <<
qcad requires a version of qt less than 3.0 to be installed in order to compile
properly. This is an upstream limitation.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
Customised CompileScript and InstallScripts to compile and install properly.
