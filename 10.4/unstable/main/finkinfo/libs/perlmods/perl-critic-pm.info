Description: Critique Perl source code for best-practices
DescDetail: <<
    Perl::Critic is an extensible framework for creating and applying coding
    standards to Perl source code. Essentially, it is a static source code
    analysis engine. Perl::Critic is distributed with a number of
    Perl::Critic::Policy modules that attempt to enforce various coding
    guidelines. Most Policy modules are based on Damian Conway's book Perl
    Best Practices. However, Perl::Critic is not limited to PBP and will
    even support Policies that contradict Conway. You can enable, disable,
    and customize those Polices through the Perl::Critic interface. You can
    also create new Policy modules that suit your own tastes.

    For a command-line interface to Perl::Critic, see the documentation for
    perlcritic. If you want to integrate Perl::Critic with your build
    process, Test::Perl::Critic provides an interface that is suitable for
    test scripts. Also, Test::Perl::Critic::Progressive is useful for
    gradually applying coding standards to legacy code. For the ultimate
    convenience (at the expense of some flexibility) see the criticism
    pragma.
