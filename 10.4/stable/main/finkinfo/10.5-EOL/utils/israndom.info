Description: Kolmogorov powered randomness tester
DescDetail: <<
	israndom tests a sequence of symbols for randomness. israndom tries
	to determine if a given sequence of trials could reasonably be
	assumed to be from a random uniform distribution over a fixed-size
	alphabet of 2-256 symbols. It uses mathematical results from
	Kolmogorov Complexity theory and Shannon entropy (in classical
	information theory) in order to determine if a given sequence is
	effectively random or not. It does this by bounding the Kolmogorov
	complexity function from above using compressors.
