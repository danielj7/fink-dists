Description: Reads and writes spatial data files
DescDetail: <<
Fiona is OGR's neat, nimble, no-nonsense API.

Fiona provides a minimal, uncomplicated Python interface to the open source GIS
community's most trusted geodata access library and integrates readily with
other Python GIS packages such as pyproj_, Rtree_, and Shapely_.

How minimal? Fiona can read feature records as mappings from shapefiles or
other GIS vector formats and write mappings as records to files using the same
formats. That's all. There aren't any feature or geometry classes. Records and
their geometries are just data.
