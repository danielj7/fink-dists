Description: CVSup server
DescDetail: <<
The CVSup Daemon. This package is sufficient if you are only interested in 
running a CVSup 
Server. 
IMPORTANT NOTE: To use the cvsup server you need to set passwords with the 
supplied 
cvpasswd utility. Please refer to the man page for a detailed description on 
what this
tool does.

See cvsup-client if you wish to access CVSup repositories.
<<      

DescPort: <<
This port has been made possible by Peter O'Gorman and who helped me a lot 
with the CVSup 
info file and Matthias Neeracher who packaged the needed Modula 3 compiler.
I and the Fink Project also thank Landon Fuller for his dport packages which 
helped porting 
things to Fink.
<<


DescUsage: <<
For detailed instructions how you can make proper use of CVSup please see the 
excellent FAQ at http://www.cvsup.org/faq.html or in your doc directory.

Description: Optimized Network File Distribution System

DescDetail: <<
CVSup is a software package for distributing and updating collections of files 
across a network. It can efficiently and accurately mirror all types of files, 
including sources, binaries, hard links, symbolic links, and even device 
nodes. 
CVSup's streaming communication protocol and multithreaded architecture make 
it 
most likely the fastest mirroring tool in existence today.

CVSup was conceived and developed by John Polstra, a consultant whose 
specialties 
include high-performance network communications. 

In addition to being a great general-purpose mirroring tool, CVSup includes 
special
features and optimizations specifically tailored to CVS repositories.
