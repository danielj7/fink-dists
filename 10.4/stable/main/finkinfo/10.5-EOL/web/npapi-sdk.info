DescDetail: <<
The goal of this project is to provide a set of reference NPAPI headers which 
all browser and plugin projects can use. 
Additionally it will contain utility code and sample code to make life easier 
for NPAPI developers. 
<<
DescPackaging: <<
Upstream hasn't released versioned packages, so this package
was taken from a 20111013 snapshot, which corresponds to 
version 0.27, according to npapi.h.

May need to add additional -D CFLAGS...

Added a pkgconfig file, taken from:
