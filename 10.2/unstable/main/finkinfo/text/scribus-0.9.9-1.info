Description: Layout program
DescDetail: <<
Scribus is a Layout program for Linux., similar to Adobe PageMaker[tm], 
QuarkXPress[tm] or Adobe. InDesign[tm], except that it is published under 
the GNU GPL. 

Currently, it is still in its early stages of development, but rapidly
maturing and very useable. Already, it has the ability to layout
newsletters, create corporate stationery, small posters and other
documents which need flexible layout and/or the ability to output to
professional quality imagesetting equipment. You can do all the
typical tasks like placing and rotating text and/or images on a page,
specify manual kerning of type and much more.

While the goals of the program are for ease of use and simple easy to
understand tools, Scribus offers support for professional publishing
features, such as CMYK color, easy PDF creation, Encapsulated
Postscript import/export and creation of color separations.

Graphic formats which can be placed include Ecapsulated Post Script
(eps), Joint Photographic Experts Group (jpeg), Portable Network
Graphics (png) and XPixMap(xpm)

DescUsage: <<
 Online documentation is no in separate packages. Install
 the scribus-i18n-en package for the English documentation.
 The package scribus-samples contains some example files.
<<
DescPort: <<
 The Makefile needs some help for the final linking.
 The declaration of error disagreed with the one of dlerror in dlfcn.h 
 from dlcompat.
 The Little CMS library lcms is now required.
