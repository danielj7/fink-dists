Package: wsmake
Version: 0.6.5pre1
Revision: 24
Description: Website pre-processor and build tool
DescDetail: <<
Wsmake is a website make tool for website development and maintenance.
It features tag substitution, page ordering, and 'make'-like dependency
checking.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
Tarball has lots of CVS directories and part of the InstallScript is a
'cp -r', so delete the CVS dirs so they don't wind up in the .deb.
<<
DescPort: <<
#config.h.in goesn't have HAVE_DECL_GETOPT. The configure test would set it
#to #define in config.h, so instead we pass -DHAVE_DECL_GETOPT=1 manually
#(see %p/include/gnugetopt/getopt.h for details).

I'm not using --with-docbook-tools since there's already some
documentation included without dragging along all those dependencies.

I can't find the source for libtui, on which --whith-iwsmake depends.

DescUsage: Read the manual examples in share/doc/wsmake.
