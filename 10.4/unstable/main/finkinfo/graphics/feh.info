Description: Imlib2 based image viewer
DescDetail: <<
 feh is a fast, lightweight image viewer which uses imlib2. It is
 commandline-driven and supports multiple images through slideshows,
 thumbnail browsing or multiple windows, and montages or index prints (using
 TrueType fonts to display file info). Advanced features include fast dynamic
 zooming, progressive loading, loading via HTTP (with reload support for
 watching webcams), recursive file opening (slideshow of a directory
 hierarchy), and mouse wheel/keyboard control.
