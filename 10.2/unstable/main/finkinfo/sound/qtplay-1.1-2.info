DescUsage: <<
 By default, qtplay tries to play all files in the current
 directory. The -cd switch does not work in 10.2 because the Finder
 now renames the disc according to CDDB lookup. Switch to the cd
 directory first or specify it directly:

 qtplay "/Volumes/The CD Name"

 qtplay -h
 usage: qtplay [OPTION] [file(s)]
        qtplay [OPTION] -cd

 -l   loop
 -q   quiet
 -r   recursive
 -v   verbose
 -z   shuffle play
 -Z   random play

DescPackaging: <<
 Command-line tool built using Apple '-framework' and '-prebind'
 flags. Patch fixes possible qt bug where white boxes show on screen
 when playing movies, submitted upstream.
