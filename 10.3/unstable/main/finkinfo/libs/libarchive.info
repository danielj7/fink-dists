  DescDetail: <<
  The bsdtar program is FreeBSD's modern implementation of tar based
  on libarchive. It started as a test harness, but has grown into a
  feature-competitive replacement for GNU tar.
  
  Following formats are supported ('r' for reading and 'w' for writing).
  On read, compression and format are always detected automatically.
  [rw] gzip compression
  [rw] bzip2 compression
  [r ] compress/LZW compression
  [r ] GNU tar format (including GNU long filenames, long link names, and
       sparse files)
  [r ] Solaris 9 extended tar format (including ACLs)
  [r ] Old V7 tar archives
  [rw] POSIX 1003.1-1988 ustar
  [rw] POSIX 1003.1-2001 pax interchange format (indeed extended ustar)
  [ w] "restricted" pax format, which will create ustar archives except for
       entries that require pax extensions (for long filenames, ACLs, etc).
  [rw] POSIX octet-oriented cpio
  [r ] SVR4 ASCII cpio
  [r ] Binary cpio (big-endian or little-endian)
  [r ] ISO9660 CD-ROM images (with optional Rockridge extensions)
  [r ] ZIP archives (with uncompressed or "deflate" compressed entries)
  [ w] shar archives
  [rw] GNU and BSD 'ar' archives
  <<
  DescUsage: <<
  You can usually use bsdtar in the same way to GNU tar but there are
  some differences. Read bsdtar(1) manpage for details.

Libarchive is a stream-oriented library for variety of archives.
It focuses on tar format and its variants primarily, but can also

On read, compression and format are always detected automatically.
[rw] gzip compression
[rw] bzip2 compression
[r ] compress/LZW compression
[r ] GNU tar format (including GNU long filenames, long link names, and
     sparse files)
[r ] Solaris 9 extended tar format (including ACLs)
[r ] Old V7 tar archives
[rw] POSIX 1003.1-1988 ustar
[rw] POSIX 1003.1-2001 pax interchange format (indeed extended ustar)
[ w] "restricted" pax format, which will create ustar archives except for
     entries that require pax extensions (for long filenames, ACLs, etc).

Guide to Documentation installed by this system:
 * libarchive.3 gives an overview of the library as a whole
 * archive_read.3, archive_write.3, and archive_write_disk.3 provide
   detailed calling sequences for the read and write APIs
 * archive_entry.3 details the "struct archive_entry" utility class
 * libarchive-formats.5 documents the file formats supported by the library
 * tar.5 provides some detailed information about a variety of different
   "tar" formats.

DescPort: <<
Since Darwin/MacOS X does not support any tape device, the default
device is changed to stdio. The manpage warns users not to rely on
this behaviour or they knock the real tape device on other platforms.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
Bsdtar command is changed to link libarchive dynamically.
