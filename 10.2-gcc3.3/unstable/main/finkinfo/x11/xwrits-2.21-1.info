Description: Reminds you to take wrist breaks
DescDetail: <<
Xwrits reminds you to take wrist breaks for prevention or management
of repetitive stress injuries. When you should take a break, it pops up an
X window, the warning window. You click on the warning window, then take a
break. The window changes appearance while you take the break. It changes
again when your break is over. Then you just resume typing. Xwrits hides
itself until you should take another break.
