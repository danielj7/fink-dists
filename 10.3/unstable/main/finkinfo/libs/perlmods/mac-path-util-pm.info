# Documentation.
DescDetail: <<
Convert between Darwin (Unix) and Mac file paths.

This is not as simple as changing the directory separator.  The Mac
path has the volume name in it, whereas the darwin path leaves off the
startup volume name because it is mounted as /.  Mac::Path::Util can
optionally use Mac::Carbon to determine the real startup volume name
(off by default) if you have installed Mac::Carbon.  You can use this
module on other platforms too.  Once the module has looked up the vol-
ume name, it caches it.  If you want to reset the cache, use the
clear_startup() method.
