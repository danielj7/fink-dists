DescDetail: <<
LAM (Local Area Multicomputer) is an MPI programming environment and 
development system for heterogeneous computers on a network.  With LAM, a 
dedicated cluster or an existing network computing infrastructure can act 
as one parallel computer solving one problem. 

LAM features extensive debugging support in the application development 
cycle and peak performance for production applications.  LAM features a 
full implementation of the MPI communication standard.  
<< 
DescPackaging: <<
Please Note: If you are on a case-insensitive file system (e.g. Mac HFS 
Extended), your c++ wrapper compiler will be named mpic++. If on a case-
sensitive file system (e.g. UFS), your c++ wrapper compiler will be named 
mpiCC. Builds with ROMIO, fortran, c++ and trillium support. 
The include and library files have been placed in subdirectories named
"lammpi" to avoid file collisions with those from the openmpi packages.
Executables which collide with those in openmpi have been renamed
with an "lam-" prefix and symlinks provided to the original names 
through the lammpi-dev package.

<<
DescUsage: <<
The LAM-MPI system is started with the command...
    lamboot -v ~/lamhosts
where the lamhosts file contants the boot schema for the available
processors and nodes.
