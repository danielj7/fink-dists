Description: Graphical musical score editor
DescPackaging: <<
 This version is compiled with g++-3.3, even in the 10.4 tree.  If it is
 ever updated to a more recent compiler, any packages which depend on
 this one must be updated at the same time.
<<
DescDetail: <<
Denemo is the GNU graphical musical score editor, and serves as a frontend to
Lilypond. 
Though its behavior and features will no doubt continue to be refined, it is
already perfectly usable.
<<
DescUsage: <<
The provided keymapping is somewhat different from the one described
in share/doc/denemo/README because of the way the keyboard is mapped
in XDarwin. Note also that the keymapping was done on a french
keyboard so everything may not work for you.  You can refer to
.denemo/keymaprc in your home directory for more details.
<<
DescPort: <<
Mostly changes around malloc.h
NLS disabled due to a bug with keymapping
OS X keymapping provided as default
Avoid symbol collision with glib2
