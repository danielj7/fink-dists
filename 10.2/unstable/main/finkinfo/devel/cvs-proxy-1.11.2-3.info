Description: Version control system + HTTP proxy support
DescDetail: <<
 CVS is the Concurrent Versions System, the dominant open-source
 network-transparent version control system. CVS is useful for
 everyone from individual developers to large, distributed teams:
	- Its client-server access method lets developers access the
	  latest code from anywhere there's an Internet connection.
	- Its unreserved check-out model to version control avoids
	  artificial conflicts common with the exclusive check-out model.
	- Its client tools are available on most platforms.
