DescDetail: <<
The authentication plugin provides generic user support.  It is the basis for
both authentication (checking the user is who they claim to be), and
authorization (allowing the user to do what the system authorises them to do).

Using authentication is split into two parts.  A Store is used to actually
store the user information, and can store any amount of data related to the
user.  Multiple stores can be accessed from within one application.
Credentials are used to verify users, using the store, given data from the
frontend.

To implement authentication in a Catalyst application you need to add this
module, plus at least one store and one credential module.

Authentication data can also be stored in a session, if the application is
using the Catalyst::Plugin::Session module.
