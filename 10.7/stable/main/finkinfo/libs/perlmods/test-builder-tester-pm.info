Maintainer: Daniel Macks <dmacks@netspace.org>

DescUsage: <<
Test::Builder::Tester was absorbed into test-simple. This package is
provided for compatibility/upgrading to continue to provide that
module, which is included in perl core as of 5.8.8 and is therefore
automatically available for the system-perl version OS X >= 10.5.

DescPackaging: <<
	Former maintainer: Blair Zajac <blair@orcaware.com>

	We do not use the technical "obsolete" designation because
	that would make all dependants want to upgrade their
	dependencies to test-simple-pmXXX, which is perl-version
	varianted whereas the old test-builder-tester-pm was not. No
	need to make them suddenly become perl-version varianted or
	have to make Distribution-specific module for each different
	system-perl version. Once we drop support for OS X 10.4, we
	can become a proper obsolete package because "all supported
	distros" will automatically have Test::Builder::Tester support
	in system-perl.
