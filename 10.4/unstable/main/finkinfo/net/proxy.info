DescDetail: <<
Proxy is not a caching proxy server, but is more a port redirector
(which can be used for NATing packets behind a linux firewall). You
would set up Proxy to listen on a certain port and forward all traffic
that comes in on that port to some port on a remote machine. The
current version of Proxy only handles TCP, but there are plans to add
support for UDP. We also plan to add a caching engine to proxy at some
point in the future as well.  For every client that connects to proxy
on it's listening port, Proxy spawns a thread to deal with that
client.

Proxy can also do IP filtering, please don't confuse this with packet
filtering for which there is a huge differnce. Proxy can read the IP
address of a client and compare it with rules in a filters file to
determine whether or not to drop the connection.
