## Diffs with previous %v _ besides dependencies (note also gdbm -> gdbm3) :
## 1) the previous trouble with linking tmpl_inst.o [presumably ld didn't want to see in a -lxyz.a an object
##    with the same name as one of the objects to be linked (flat_namespace spirit ?)] has disappeared _ don't
##    know with what %v of the dev-tools. So ref's to that trouble have been deleted, and line 3 in the patchscript
##    is related too.
## 2) make check added for the moment _ and the last line of the patchscript is to let the build complete normally
##    despite the failure of make check at some point. [A diff with the log of the prev %r (with the same ine added
##    in patchscript) shows the results of make check are identical in both cases _ but for the timings of course !]
## 3) line 5 in the patchscript is to link with the additional deps (note: not only ntl, but also cfmem)
## 4) line 6 is to zap all -I/sw/include flags that preceded some flag referring to the build-dir
## 5) Finally line 4 : this was the only way I found to link correctly here. It seems rather fragile (that's part of
##    the reason of the make check..) : eg, just adding NoSetLDFLAGS: true and SetLIBRARY_PATH: %p/lib would
##    give there an executable that crashes ('Bus Error') at the first use ... Apple's mysteries !

Description: Computer algebra system for algebraic geometry
DescDetail: <<
 Note that this version of Macaulay2 is somewhat unstable, and may crash.
 A better version is forthcoming soon.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
 This version is compiled with g++-3.3, even in the 10.4 tree.  If it is
 ever updated to a more recent compiler, the group of packages macaulay2,
 ntl, singular-factory, and singular-libfac (and any packages which depend on
 any of them) must all be updated at the same time.
<<
DescPort: <<
 Version 0.9.2-6 uses extensive patches for gcc 3.1 provided by the
 upstream authors.
<<
DescUsage: <<
 Users should put the following line in their .emacs files:
   (load "/sw/lib/Macaulay2-0.9.2/emacs/M2-init.el")
 If you experience segmentation faults with Macaulay2, you may need to
 run the command "limit stacksize 5m" prior to the command "M2".
