Description: File System in User Space (fuse4x)
DescDetail: <<
Fuse4x allows you to extend Mac OS X's native file handling
capabilities via third-party file systems. Fuse4x is a successor to
MacFUSE, which has been used as a software building block by dozens of
products, but is no longer being maintained.

These are the fuse header and library files required for building FUSE
filesystems.
