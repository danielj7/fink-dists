Description: Python bindings for the Qt toolkit
DescUsage: <<
To use pyuic4, pylupdate4, or pyrcc4, you need to make sure that
%p/lib/qt4-mac/lib/python%type_raw[python]/bin is in your PATH.  

For other software to use the pyqt4 libraries, it will be
necessary to modify PYTHONPATH to include
%p/lib/qt4-mac/lib/python%type_raw[python]/site-packages.

Fink package maintainers may need to figure out where in a
package PYTHONPATH is set/modified in order to patch the 
package to include the fink pyqt4 location in PYTHONPATH.

<<
DescPackaging: <<
 Rolling the old -bin splitoff into the main package, and installing
 all components in non-standard locations so that different
 python versions and x11/mac versions will not conflict or
 interfere with each other.
 
 PyQt4-mac-4.7.4 requires SIP 4.10.5 when it is built.
