Description: GTK+ Napster client
DescDetail: <<
Gnapster is a GTK+ Napster client that can also access Opennap servers. It has
support for multiple servers, fetching opennap server lists and downloading of 
avi and mpg files, among others.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
InstallScript removes unnecessarily created 'lib' directory.
<<
DescPort: <<
Config files updated for Darwin compatibility.
<<
DescUsage: <<
Due to a bug with MacOS X, the ~/.gnapster directory cannot be created by 
Gnapster. In order to save preferences, the .gnapster directory must be created
manually in your home directory, using 'mkdir ~/.gnapster' as the user using
Gnapster.
