 A replacement for the interactive Python interpreter with extra functionality.

 Maintainer's note: IPython seems to have some problem with Apple terminal settings.
 In order to fix this please change the TERM value to 'xterm' (setenv TERM xterm) before calling
 IPython. For further explanations or suggestions to fix this issue contact me at my email address.
