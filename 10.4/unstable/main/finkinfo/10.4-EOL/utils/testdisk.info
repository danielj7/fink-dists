DescDetail: <<
 TestDisk is a powerful free data recovery software! It was primarily designed
 to help recover lost partitions and/or make non-booting disks bootable again
 when these symptoms are caused by faulty software, certain types of viruses or
 human error (such as accidentally deleting a Partition Table). Partition table
 recovery using TestDisk is really easy.

 TestDisk can

    * Fix partition table, recover deleted partition
    * Recover FAT32 boot sector from its backup
    * Rebuild FAT12/FAT16/FAT32 boot sector
    * Fix FAT tables
    * Rebuild NTFS boot sector
    * Recover NTFS boot sector from its backup
    * Fix MFT using MFT mirror
    * Locate ext2/ext3 Backup SuperBlock (NB: disabled in Fink package)
    * Undelete files from FAT filesystem
    * Copy files from deleted FAT, NTFS and ext2/ext3 partitions. 

 TestDisk has features for both novices and experts. For those who know little
 or nothing about data recovery techniques, TestDisk can be used to collect
 detailed information about a non-booting drive which can then be sent to a
 tech for further analysis. Those more familiar with such procedures should
 find TestDisk a handy tool in performing onsite recovery.  

 This package also includes PhotoRec, a tool for recovering deleted files from
 digital photo media.

DescUsage: <<
 This package is built without support for the following features:

     * ext2fs
     * reiserfs
     * ewf

 When the appropriate packages are added to Fink (e2fsprogs, progreiserfs,
 libewf), send me an email and I'll be happy to release an updated package.
