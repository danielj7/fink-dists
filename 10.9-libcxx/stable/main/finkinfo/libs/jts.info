DescDetail: <<
The JTS Topology Suite is an API of 2D spatial predicates and
functions.  It has the following design goals:

* JTS conforms to the Simple Features Specification for SQL published
  by the Open GIS Consortium
* JTS provides a complete, consistent, robust implementation of
  fundamental 2D spatial algorithms
* JTS is fast enough for production use
* JTS is written in 100% pure JavaTM
* JTS is open source (under the LGPL license)
