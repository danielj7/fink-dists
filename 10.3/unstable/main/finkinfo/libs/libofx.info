DescDetail: <<
This is the LibOFX library.  It is a API designed to allow applications to very
easily support OFX command responses, usually provided by financial 
institutions.  
See http://www.ofx.net/ofx/default.asp for details and specification. 
This project was first started as my end of degree project, with the objective
to add OFX support to GnuCash http://www.gnucash.org/ If you can read French, 
the original project presentation is included in the doc directory.  
I finally decided to make it into a generic library, so all OpenSource 
financial software can benefit.
