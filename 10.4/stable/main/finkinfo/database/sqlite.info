Package: sqlite
Version: 2.8.5
Revision: 1014

Description: Embedded SQL database
DescDetail: <<
SQLite is a C library that implements an embeddable SQL database engine.
Programs that link with the SQLite library can have SQL database access
without running a separate RDBMS process. The distribution comes with a
standalone command-line access program ( sqlite ) that can be used to
administer an SQLite database and which serves as an example of how to
use the SQLite library.
<<
DescPort: <<
Patch configure to find the Fink readline headers. This package requires 
readline present to build due to issues with the default sqlite configure
script when run on OS X.
