DescPort: <<
 - dirent.h on OS X has a but, it deos not include sys/types.h
 - no malloc.h on OS X -> just removed it
 - no localtime_r / gmtime_r on OS X, so we provide our own
 - no pthread_kill on OS X currently. Just removed the single call to it for now
 - mail/Mail.h (generated from mail/Mail.idl) overwrites mail/mail.h (stupid HFS+)
   For now, I just renamed mail.h to mail-real.h. Better would be to rename Mail.h/Mail.idl
 - static links the correct db3 version
 - no gtk-doc support, since it will only work if an X11 server is running at build time (ouch)
 
 For 10.2 the patches for loacltime_r gmtime_r and strptime were removed, libc now provides these
 pthread_kill is also provided, so was put back in also. libtool needed the usual patches, conflicting
 builddepends for db3 and db31 were sorted out.

 Also consider making a crypto version with kerberos support!
