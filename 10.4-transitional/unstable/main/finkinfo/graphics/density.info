Description: 3D volume file processing for simvoleon
DescDetail: <<
Provides programs to create, interpret, and display volume files in
SIMVoleon format.  These are voxel/3D density representations.
Includes simple view for creating flight paths and screen shots.  You
can then use render to create frames for fly-through movies.

This package come out of Kurt Schwehr's PhD thesis so it has
additional scripts and programs for processing Anisotropy of Magnetic
Susceptability.  However, the programs should be useful to anyone
using SIM Voleon/Coin.

Recommend (but not required) that you install the pmag package by Lisa
Tauxe which is not currently in fink.  If you want to run the complete
demo, you must install pmag.  You can get the info file from Kurt
Schwehr.

DescPort: <<
Do NOT put this in fink yet outside of your local directory.  This
is still beta software and does not belong in fink.
