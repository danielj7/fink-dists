Description: Color screen text using ANSI escape sequences
DescPort: <<
Fix install.rb script for .deb build (cf. direct install).

Prior to 0.0.3-2, there was a ruby-versionless term-ansicolor-rb whose
install behavior depended on which version of %p/bin/ruby one had. We
now have correct variants: they all must Replaces the simple -rb but
not Conflicts since that leads to deadlocks when users have other
packages installed that Depends on the -rb. The latest revisions of
these packages have been changed to the new -rbXX, so simply updating
them will fix potential runtime brokenness in them.
