Description: The Ogg Vorbis CODEC tools
DescDetail:  Ogg Vorbis is a fully Open, non-proprietary, patent-and-royalty-free, 
 general-purpose compressed audio format for mid to high quality 
 (8kHz-48.0kHz, 16+ bit, polyphonic) audio and music at fixed and 
 variable bitrates from 16 to 128 kbps/channel. This places Vorbis 
 in the same competetive class as audio representations such as 
 MPEG-4 (AAC), and similar to, but higher performance than MPEG-1/2 
 audio layer 3, MPEG-4 audio (TwinVQ), WMA and PAC.
 .
 Vorbis is the first of a planned family of Ogg multimedia coding 
 formats being developed as part of Xiph.org's Ogg multimedia project.
