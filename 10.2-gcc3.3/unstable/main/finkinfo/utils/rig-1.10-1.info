Description: Random Identity Generator
DescDetail: <<
RIG (Random Identity Generator) is a free replacement for a shareware
program out there called 'fake'. It generates random, yet
real-looking, personal data. It is useful if you need to feed a name
to a Web site, BBS, or real person, and are too lazy to think of one
yourself. Also, if the Web site/BBS/person you are giving the
information to tries to cross-check the city, state, zip, or area
code, it will check out.
