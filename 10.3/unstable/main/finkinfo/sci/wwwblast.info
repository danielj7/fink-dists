Description: WWW BLAST
DescDetail: <<
This standalone WWW BLAST server suite of programs was designed similar to
the regular NCBI BLAST server and such command-line NCBI BLAST programs like
"blastall", "blastpgp", "rpsblast" and "megablast". It incorporates most
features, which exist in NCBI BLAST programs and should be relatively easy
to use. This server does not support any request queuing and load balancing.
As soon as the user hits a "Search" button, BLAST starts immediately if
entered information is valid. So, this server is not intended to handle
large load, which may exist in public service. Such queueing and
loadbalancing however may be implemented using such products as Load Sharing
Facility - "LSF" from Platform Computing Corporation. Interface to "LSF" was
implemented in NCBI, however this was not included in this suite. Standalone
server assumes that users have their own BLAST or RPS-BLAST database(s),
that should be searched and want to have a simple WWW interface to such
search. It is STRONLY recommended that user has experience in installation
and running standalone NCBI BLAST programs.

DescUsage: <<
****************************************
For wwwblast to work, you must edit /etc/httpd/httpd.conf.

Change \"Timeout 300\" to \"Timeout 3600\".

Uncomment the following three lines:

LoadModule vhost_alias_module libexec/httpd/mod_vhost_alias.so
AddModule mod_vhost_alias.c
AddHandler cgi-script .cgi

Add the following two sections in the appropriate places:

<Directory /sw/share/wwwblast>
    Options FollowSymLinks ExecCGI
    AllowOverride None
    Order allow,deny
    Allow from all
</Directory>

<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName blast.your.domain
    DocumentRoot /sw/share/wwwblast
</VirtualHost>

Also, you will have to add the host
blast.your.domain to NetInfo:
sudo niload hosts / <<-
127.0.0.1 blast.your.domain
-
where \"your.domain\" is the name of your domain
and then restart apache:
sudo apachectl restart
****************************************
To demonstrate wwwblast, point your browser to:
http://blast.your.domain/
****************************************
To make wwwblast site specific, run:
sudo /sw/share/wwwblast/config.pl

This creates a blast.rc and a psiblast.rc file in the
/sw/share/wwwblast directory. You may adjust the
number of processors in these rc files. It also creates
aa.html and nt.html files in this directory. You can
then cut and paste the <option> entries from these html
files into the corresponding place in blast.html,
megablast.html, and psiblast.html (overwriting the
<option> for test_aa_db and test_na_db).
