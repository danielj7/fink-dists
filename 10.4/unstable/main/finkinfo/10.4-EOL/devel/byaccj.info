Description: Berkeley YACC with Java code generation support
DescDetail: << 
 BYACC/Java is an extension of the Berkeley v 1.8 YACC-compatible
 parser generator. Standard YACC takes a YACC source file, and
 generates one or more C files from it, which if compiled properly,
 will produce a LALR-grammar parser. This is useful for expression
 parsing, interactive command parsing, and file reading. Many megabytes
 of YACC code have been written over the years.

 This is the standard YACC tool that is in use every day to produce
 C/C++ parsers. I have added a "-J" flag which will cause BYACC to
 generate Java source code, instead. So there finally is a YACC for
 Java now!
