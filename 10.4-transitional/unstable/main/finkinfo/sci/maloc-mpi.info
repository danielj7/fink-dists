Description: Hardware abstraction library (mpi version)
DescDetail: <<
MALOC (Minimal Abstraction Layer for Object-oriented C) is a small, portable,
abstract C environment library for object-oriented C programming. MALOC is
used as the foundation layer for a number of scientific applications,
including MC, SG, and APBS. MALOC can be used as a small stand-alone
abstraction environment for writing portable C programs that need access to
resources that are typically architecture-dependent, such as INET sockets,
timing routines, and so on. MALOC provides abstract datatypes, memory
management routines, timing routines, machine epsilon, access to UNIX and
INET sockets, MPI, and so on. All things that can vary from one architecture
to another are abstracted out of an application code and placed in MALOC. To
port the application code to a new architecture, only the small MALOC library
needs to be ported (usually just "./configure ; make"). MALOC takes the pain
of varying UNIX (and Win32) platforms with differing library and header
layous completely out of the software development picture.
.
By default, MALOC builds libblas.a.  This default is disabled because OS X
provides its own BLAS in the Accelerate.framework.
.
maloc-mpi should be used for multi-processor machines.  maloc can be used with
any number of processors.
