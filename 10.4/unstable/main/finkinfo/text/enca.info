Description: Extremely Naive Charset Analyser
DescDetail: <<
Enca (Extremely Naive Charset Analyser) consists of two main components:

 * libenca, an encoding detection library.  It currently supports
   Belarussian, Bulgarian, Croatian, Czech, Estonian, Hungarian, Latvian,
   Lithuanian, Polish, Russian, Slovak, Slovene, Ukrainian, Chinese, and
   some multibyte encodings independently on language.  The API should be
   relatively stable (to be read as `it will either change only
   marginally, or very drastically').

 * enca, a command line frontend, integrating libenca and several
   charset conversion libraries and tools (GNU recode, UNIX98 iconv,
   perl Unicode::Map, cstocs).
