DescPackaging: <<
	Upstream doesn't understand API versioning. Fake a fink idea
	of libversion by placing it in a subdir and link it back from
	lib/ so other packages won't have to worry about this mess.
	See: https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=11988

	Import patches from gentoo portage package:
		rarian-0.6.0-posix-getopt.patch
		rarian-0.6.0-reg-return.patch
	posix-getopt avoids needing rarian:Depends:getoptbin

	Needs Depends:docbook-dtd somewhere?
