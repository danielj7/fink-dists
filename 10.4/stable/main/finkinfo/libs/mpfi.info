# DISCLAIMER: Max Horn is the sole maintainer of this package.
# Please DO NOT MAKE MODIFICATIONS without informing the maintainer.
# Preferably, send a patch to me instead of making changes yourself!
# If that is not possible due to extra urgency, at least send me a mail.
#
# Explanation: I am sick and tired of getting back to my packages and
# discovering that people have messed with it. I am then forced to
# retrace their steps, find out who, when and why did make a certain
# change etc. -- i.e. it makes my life as maintainer harder.
# Furthermore, as maintainer I am responsible for problems caused by my
# packages. But I am not willing to take responsibility for something I
# did not do. In particular, for changes that other people introduced
# behind my back, no matter how good and noble their intentions were. As
# such, I may see myself forced to drop responsibility for (and hence,
# maintainership of) the affected package.

Description: Library for interval arithmetic
DescDetail: <<
MPFI is intended to be a portable library written in C for arbitrary
precision interval arithmetic with intervals represented using MPFR
reliable floating-point numbers. It is based on the GNU MP library and on
the MPFR library. The purpose of an arbitrary precision interval arithmetic
is on the one hand to get guaranteed results, thanks to interval
computation, and on the other hand to obtain accurate results, thanks to
multiple precision arithmetic. The MPFI library is built upon MPFR in order
to benefit from the correct roundings provided by MPFR. Further advantages
of using MPFR are its portability and compliance with the IEEE 754 standard
for floating-point arithmetic.
