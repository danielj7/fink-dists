DescDetail: <<
Today opensource graphics applications seem to like to work out uniform
solutions.  Krita uses GIMP's brushes, Inkscape uses GIMP's color swatches
files.  Still missing are ways to share resources like brushes, so that users
wouldn't need to install all of these resources separately for each and every
application that can read such data.

The intention of this specification is to work out uniform rules for storing
possibly shared data, which would let developers benefit from no efforts
duplication; packagers benefit from no efforts duplication; users benefit from
using one root directory for all art supplies and one art supplies registry
for all applications.
