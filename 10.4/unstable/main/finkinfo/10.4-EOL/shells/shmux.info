DescDetail: <<
 shmux is program for executing the same command on many hosts in parallel. For
 each target, a child process is spawned by shmux, and a shell on the target
 obtained one of the supported methods: rsh, ssh, or sh. The output produced by
 the children is received by shmux and either (optionally) output in turn to
 the user using an easy to read format, or written to files for later
 processing making it well suited for use in scripts.
