+.SH NAME
+taskjuggler \- The taskjuggler project management software
+.SH SYNOPSIS
+.ll +8
+.B taskjuggler
+.RB [ " options " ]
+[
+.I "file \&..."
+]
+.ll -8
+.SH DESCRIPTION
+TaskJuggler is a modern and powerful, Open Source project management 
+tool. Its new approach to project planning and tracking is more flexible 
+and superior to the commonly used Gantt chart editing tools. It has 
+already been successfully used in many projects and scales easily to 
+projects with hundreds of resources and thousands of tasks.
+.SH OPTIONS
+.TP
+.B --help
+Print all command line options with a short description.
+.TP
+.B --version 
+Print the version and copyright info.
+.TP
+.B \-v
+Same as '--version'.
+.TP
+.B \-s  
+Stop TaskJuggler's run after syntax check. This option is for testing and debugging purposes only.
+.TP
+.B \-M  
+Output fragment of a Makefile that lists the dependencies of the passed TaskJuggler files.
+.TP
+.B --makefile <file> 
+Similar to '-M' but write the dependency information into the specified file.
+.TP
+.B --maxerrors N 
+Specifies the number of errors after which TaskJuggler stops checking the input files. If N is 0 all errors are displayed.
+.TP
+.B --nodepcheck  
+Do not check for dependency loops. The loop detector uses an algorithm that needs exponentially more time the bigger the dependency network gets. So for large projects it can be desirable to skip the dependency loop detection. This does not affect the task scheduling but can lead to error messages that are difficult to associate with the dependency specification that is wrong.
+.TP
+.B --debug N 
+Print debug output; N must be between 0 and 4, the higher N the more output is printed. This option is for testing and debugging purposes only.
+.TP
+.B --dbmode N  
+Limit debug output to certain modules of the code; N is a bit mask. Each set bit activates output of a certain module. Currently the following modules are supported: Project File Reader (1), Project Scheduler (2), Task Scheduler (4), Resource Scheduler (8), Expression Tree Evaluator (16). This option is for testing and debugging purposes only.
+.TP
+.B --warnerror 
+Warnings are treated as errors.
