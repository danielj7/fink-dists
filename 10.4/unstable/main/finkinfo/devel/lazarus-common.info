Description: Free Pascal IDE: common parts
DescDetail: <<
Lazarus is an open-source development system that builds on the Free Pascal 
compiler by adding an integrated development environment (IDE).
It includes a syntax-highlighting code editor and a visual form designer, 
as well as a component library that is highly compatible with Delphi's 
Visual Component Library (VCL).  The Lazarus Component Library (LCL) 
includes  equivalents for many of the familiar VCL controls such as 
forms, buttons, text boxes and so on, which are used to create 
applications with a graphical user interface (GUI).

<<
DescUsage: <<
 This is the common part of the lazarus packages and used implicitly.
<<
DescPort: <<
Lazarus with a gtk2 interface does not work, yet. It crashes on startup,
but gtk2 can probably still be used to build own applications.
