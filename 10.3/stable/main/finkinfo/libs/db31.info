Description: Berkeley DB embedded database
DescPackaging: <<
This package only contains static libs, and it not seperated into splitoffs.
Also it makes sure to name the library and the include dir differently from
the regular db3 package. That is so because this package is only meant to be
a build time dependency for Evolution, which depends on this specific version
of db, and it is not to be used for anything else.
