Description: Copies data from one file or block device to another
DescDetail: <<
 dd_rescue is a tool to help you to save data from crashed partition. It tries to
 read and if it fails, it will go on with the next sectors where tools like dd will
 fail. If the copying process is interrupted by the user it is possible to continue
 at any position later. It can copy backwards.
