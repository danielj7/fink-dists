DescDetail: <<
The exportable subroutines of Lingua::EN::Inflect provide plural
inflections, "a"/"an" selection for English words, and manipulation
of numbers as words.

Plural forms of all nouns, most verbs, and some adjectives are
provided.  Where appropriate, "classical" variants (for example:
"brother" -> "brethren", "dogma" -> "dogmata", etc.) are also
provided.

Pronunciation-based "a"/"an" selection is provided for all English
words, and most initialisms.

It is also possible to inflect numerals (1,2,3) to ordinals (1st, 2nd,
3rd) and to english words ("one", "two", "three).

In generating these inflections, Lingua::EN::Inflect follows the
Oxford English Dictionary and the guidelines in Fowler's Modern
English Usage, preferring the former where the two disagree.

The module is built around standard British spelling, but is
designed to cope with common American variants as well.  Slang,
jargon, and other English dialects are not explicitly catered for.

Where two or more inflected forms exist for a single word (typically a
"classical" form and a "modern" form), Lingua::EN::Inflect prefers the
more common form (typically the "modern" one), unless "classical"
processing has been specified (see "MODERN VS CLASSICAL INFLECTIONS").
