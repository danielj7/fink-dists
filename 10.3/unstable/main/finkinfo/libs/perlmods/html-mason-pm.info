# Additional Data:
DescDetail: <<
Welcome to Mason, a Perl-based web site development and delivery
system.  Mason allows web pages and sites to be constructed from
shared, reusable building blocks called components. Components contain
a mix of Perl and HTML, and can call each other and pass values back
and forth like subroutines. Components increase modularity and
eliminate repetitive work: common design elements (headers, footers,
menus, logos) can be extracted into their own components where they
need be changed only once to affect the whole site.

Other Mason features include powerful filtering and templating
facilities, and a HTML/data caching model.  See
http://www.masonhq.com/ for more information.
