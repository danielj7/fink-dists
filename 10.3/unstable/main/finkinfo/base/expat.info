Description: C library for parsing XML
DescDetail: <<
 This is expat, a C library for parsing XML, written by James Clark.
 Expat is a stream-oriented XML parser. This means that you register
 handlers with the parser before starting the parse. These handlers
 are called when the parser discovers the associated structures in the
 document being parsed. A start tag is an example of the kind of
 structures for which you may register handlers.
<<
DescPort: <<
 placed hooks in Makefile for --mandir, and $DESTDIR

 make sure build-directory contents are used before global things
