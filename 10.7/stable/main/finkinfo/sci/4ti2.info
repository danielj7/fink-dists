Description: Software for algebra, geometry, combinatorics
DescDetail: <<
 4ti2 -- A software package for algebraic, geometric, and combinatorial
 problems on linear spaces.

DescPackaging: <<
 For the moment, we do not build shared libraries (although this could easily
 be done with "ConfigureParams: --enable-shared") because upstream does not
 appear to be versioning them.  If they ever become needed for something
 else, this package could be modified appropriately, creating a -shlibs
 splitoff.

 As of rev. 2, we do create a -dev splitoff, so that conflicts between
 4ti2's include files and those of other packages can be easily resolved.
