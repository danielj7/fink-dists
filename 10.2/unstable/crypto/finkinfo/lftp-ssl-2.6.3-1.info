Description: Sophisticated command line based FTP client
DescDetail: <<
lftp is a sophisticated command line based FTP client. It has a
multithreaded design allowing you to issue and execute multiple
commands simultaneosly or in the background. It also features
mirroring capabilities and will reconnect and continue transfers
in the event of a disconnection. Also, if you quit the program while
transfers are still in progress, it will switch to nohup mode and
finish the transfers in the background. HTTP protocol and FTP over
HTTP proxy are supported. Version 2.3.0 includes HTTPS and FTP over
SSL support.
