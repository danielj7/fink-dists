InfoDocs: planner-el
DescDetail: <<
The Emacs Planner allows one to manage tasks within emacs.  It builds
upon the `muse-el' package and thus maintains a hyperlinked summary
of tasks, notes, and other pieces of text needed to carry out one's
duties within emacs (either in whole or in part).  It is connected to
many other emacs programs, such as gnus, vm, the emacs calendar,
diary, w3, bbdb, and so on.  It thus acts as a "universal" life
manager within emacs.
<<
DescUsage: <<
Enable planner-el by adding the form

  (require 'planner-auto)

to your .emacs file.  Get started planning by evaluating the form

  (plan)

(One way of making the planner a basic part of your emacs life is by
adding this form to the end of your .emacs file.)

Begin customizing the planner by customizing the group `planner'.  Be
sure to check out the info documentation to learn more about how to
connect the planner to various emacs packages, from which much of the
planner's value derives.  The info docs also describe more generally
how to use the planner.

To use the emacs package remember (fink package `remember-el') with
the planner, add the forms

  (setq remember-handler-functions '(remember-planner-append))
  (setq remember-annotation-functions planner-annotation-functions)

to your emacs initialization file.  Doing so will add the notes
created with `remember' to be included in your day and plan pages.
