DescDetail: <<
The KDE Accessibility Project is a small on-line community of
developers and other volunteers dedicated to ensure that our
favorite desktop is accessible to all users, including those
of us with physical handicaps.

This is the set of tools created by the KDEAP.

This package doesn't install any files of itself, but makes sure that
you have a fully functional KDEAP4 system through dependencies.
