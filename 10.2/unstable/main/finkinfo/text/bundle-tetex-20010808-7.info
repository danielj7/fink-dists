DescDetail: <<
This bundle provides the same functionality as the August 8, 2001 teTeX 
distribution (by Gerben Wierda) which accompanied TeXShop.

All of the packages listed as being "recommended" were provided by more recent
versions of Wierda's distribution.

As of revision 6, this package also include dvipdfm which is found in more 
recent versions of Wierda's distribution.

Please note the Wierda's distribution has evolved substantially, and that
Wierda no longer supports the version whose functionality is reproduced
here.
