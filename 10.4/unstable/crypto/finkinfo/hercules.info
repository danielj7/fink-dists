  Description: Hercules dynamic feature modules 
  DescDetail: <<
    Dynamic modules that load up to simulate certain features
  <<
<<

Description: System/370, ESA/390, z/Architecture Emulator 
DescDetail: <<
Hercules is an open source software implementation of the mainframe 
System/370 and ESA/390 architectures, in addition to the new 
64-bit z/Architecture. Hercules runs under Linux, 
Windows 98, Windows NT, Windows 2000, Windows XP, 
and Mac OS X 10.2 and later.

Hercules was created by Roger Bowler and is maintained by Jay Maynard. 
Jan Jaeger designed and implemented many of the advanced features of
Hercules, including dynamic reconfiguration, integrated console, 
interpretive execution and z/Architecture support. 
<<
DescUsage: <<
You must start hercules from a directory containing a hercules.cnf config
file or else pass the path to the config file by using the -f flag.
A sample is provided in %p/share/doc/%N

<<
DescPort: <<
  Doesn't compile on 10.4 due to undefined struct rtentry in
  hercifc.h. <net/route.h> has it on 10.3 only, and has struct
  ortentry on both OS X. Neither rtentry (when defined) nor ortentry
  has the rt_dev element, which is used in hercifc.c. How did this
  ever work??
<<
DescPackaging: <<
  Starting in 3.02-11, %N-bin as merged into %N because %N contained
  files that were essential to the binaries and there was no reason to
  have the primary userland package not be %N.
