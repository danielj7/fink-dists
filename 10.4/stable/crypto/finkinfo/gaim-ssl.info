Description: DEPRECATED -- use Pidgin instead
DescDetail: <<
It is strongly recommended that you use the 'pidgin'
package, which is the successor of gaim, instead of this
one. Gaim does not receive any security updates anymore.
Various serious security problems with gaim have been
fixed in 'pidgin'.
