DescDetail: <<
Weka is a collection of machine learning algorithms for data mining
tasks. The algorithms can either be applied directly to a dataset or
called from your own Java code. Weka contains tools for data
pre-processing, classification, regression, clustering, association
rules, and visualization. It is also well-suited for developing new
machine learning schemes.

To start the GUI, just run 'weka'

For a quick command line sample run, try this:

	java weka.core.Instances /sw/share/doc/weka/data/weather.arff
	java weka.classifiers.trees.J48 -t /sw/share/doc/weka/data/weather.arff

DescPort: <<
Didn't compile from source since that is just available from CVS.  The
weka web site descributes a dmg for OSX and a zip for Linux.  Both
contain a bunch of jar files.  Avoided the dmg, because I'm not
familiar with what to do with them from the command line.
