DescDetail: <<
GNU Classpath, Essential Libraries for Java, is a GNU project to create free
core class libraries for use with virtual machines and compilers for the Java
programming language.
<<

DescPackaging: <<
The ConfigureParams field disables all of the GTK/GNOME stuff, which doesn't
seem to work with Fink. It also sets the infodir parameter to prevent classpath
from installing files into the deprecated %p/info directory. Note that to get
this to work, the DESTDIR parameter also has to be set in the InstallScript.

This is a one-time build, so the disable-dependency-tracking parameter is added
