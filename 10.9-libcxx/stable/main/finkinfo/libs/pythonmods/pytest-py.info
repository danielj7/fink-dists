Description: Cross-project testing tool for Python
DescDetail: <<
	py.test is a command line tool to collect, run and report about
	automated tests. It runs well on Linux, Windows and OSX and on Python
	2.4 through to 3.1 versions. It is used in many projects, ranging from
	running 10 thousands of tests to a few inlined tests on a command line
	script. As of version 1.2 you can also generate a no-dependency
	py.test-equivalent standalone script that you can distribute along with
	your application.
