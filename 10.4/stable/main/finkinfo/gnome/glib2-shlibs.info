	DescUsage: <<
Other packages may need to pass explicit -lintl when linking. glib2
used to publish this flag via .pc and .la, so others' sloppiness
previously had no visible effect. As of 2.22.4-2, the default
glib-2.0.pc does still contain that flag whereas the one in
%p/lib/glib-2.0/pkgconfig-strict does not. Packages should test with
that path in their PKG_CONFIG_PATH and add explicit flag-passing if it
fails in order to prepare for the future when the default .pc may not
have that flag.

Description: Handy library of utility functions
DescPort: <<
	glib2 provides etc/glib-2.0/charset.alias for darwin because there's
	no system-wide charset.alias.
	See also: http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=346816
	Can we figure out how to generate this (gettext-tools config.charset
	for host=darwin5?)or import it from an authoritative upstream source
	instead of dragging along a legacy file in %N.patch?

	check uses some C++ but it doesn't leak out into the installed
	package

	We need to set LANG=C when doing 'make check', else a previously
	installed glib2 will trigger a crash caused by a bug in the old
	de.po. See http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=310731
	Need to figure out how to patch tests/Makefile to use the nascent
	gettext dictionaries in preference to installed ones.

	poll() is broken on 10.4 but not 10.3; force internal emulation
	to regardless of config result so that lib builds the same everywhere
	and is portable.

	Need to patch gutils.h for inline semantics of gcc on OS X >= 10.5.
	gcc version is not sufficient to determine it (appears to be xcode-
	specific patches to gcc), so test Apple gcc build number. See:
	http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=315437 (patch	#96366 does
	not work...not __GNUC_PREREQ). No idea a portable solution, but
	msachs says "static inline" is right for this case, so hardcode it.
	2.14.5 does it "differently" but still looks like the same wrong
	patch, so leaving our existing "static inline" hard-coding patch.

	Fix glib/gslice.c clobbering of errno.
	See: http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=554092
	(patch from comments #14)

	Not fixing RTLD_GLOBAL configure test. See:
	http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=583010

	String sorting ("collation") is broken on x86_64. See:
	https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=673047
	Using upstream patch: 42be40a1f88a55ff7d333e94ac2119d2b1867e9a
	But it is still broken (but now "same" on i386 vs x86_64
	rather than being non-broken on i386).

	Fix libtool/gdb usage in a test. See:
	https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=684723

	gdbus does not support launchd, so it cannot find or launch
	buses. See: https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=690523
<<
DescPackaging: <<
	Library contains some C symbols whose real name looks like C++
	munges. This should not be construed to mean that glib2 is C++ nor
	that it needs to obey Fink C++ packaging rules. C++ is also
	used in some self-tests.

	Prior to 2.12.0-1, %N contained the gettext catalogs and the
	charset.alias file, which are used by the %N-shlibs files. Starting
	in 2.12.0-1, they are all now in the %N-shlibs package, and %N is a
	dummy for compatibility and upgrades.
	More recently, %N was nuked entirely.

	Builds with included pcre instead of external lib to avoid need to
	cascade deps on pcre packages

#	The following are newly deprecated in glib2 2.18.1 since 2.14.6:
#		g_assert_warning
#		G_GNUC_FUNCTION
#		G_GNUC_PRETTY_FUNCTION
#	And in 2.20:
#		g_volume_monitor_adopt_orphan_mount
#	And in 2.22:
#		g_drive_eject
#		g_drive_eject_finish
#		g_file_unmount_mountable
#		g_file_unmount_mountable_finish
#		g_file_eject_mountable
#		g_file_eject_mountable_finish
#		g_mount_unmount
#		g_mount_unmount_finish
#		g_volume_eject
#		g_volume_eject_finish
#	External packages and out-of-sync gnome core might still be
#	using them, so may as well leave them undeprecated until jump
#	to glib3.
^-- glib3 isn't expected ever; it's documented that G_DISABLE_* are
documented as useful and the deprecations are well-documented as well.
Making stable releases of other packages that fail (!=warn) when doing
something valid but deprecated is known to be a poor approach. Too
crazy to keep trying to track all the deprecations over many years
here.

	Leaving G_DISABLE_SINGLE_INCLUDES undefined in most places,
	though in the future it will become defined...

	Disable the FAM plugin for gio. Darwin doesn't have libfam.
	Fink has gamin, a third-party implementation available in
	fink, has a dependency on glib. Eventually package gio-fam
	separately to avoid circular dependency. But even if compiled
	and installed, gio-directory-monitoring doesn't work (does not
	detect dir creation/renaming/deletion or contained-file
	creation/deletion) so better to leave it out--gives runtime
	"Unable to find default local directory monitor type"
	diagnostic rather than silent non-workingness. Really should
	get a native file/directory monitor implementation, maybe
	using kqueue or FSEvents. See:
	https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=543148

	libgio sometimes runs %p/bin/update-desktop-database from the
	desktop-file-utils package or %p/bin/update-mime-database from
	the shared-mime-info package, but those programs link against
	libglib. Leave it as %N-shlibs:Recommends:... to break the
	circular dependency. Ick. Required for self-test, so would
	need to build (but not test) glib2, then build d-f-u & s-m-i
	against it, then rebuild glib2 with testing enabled. Ick^2.

	Make sure the update-*-database programs can be found even if
	run from a non-fink'ed shell: explicit path and fink XDG vars.
	See also: https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=673135

	Regenerating gtk-doc files The Right Way (--enable-gtk-doc) is
	very slow, so just patch the prefix in the bad URLs in the
	existing generated files.
#	2.22.4 generated docs include leakage from overly-public
#	entries in libcamel, so have to regenerate:/

	Don't install gdb files. They aren't named correctly and it's
	not clear they are usable on darwin. See:
	https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=606877
	Also, they don't even get installed in the correct location.
	See: https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=606872

	All libs are shared-only and all symbols are resolved via dyld
	so do not export dependencies' -l flags in via pkg-config.
	Reduces BuildDepends inheritance of things that are not in
	public interface.

	Fink's libffi package is busted on many platforms and OS X has
	a libffi, so use system's: BCon:libffi and hardcode compiler
	flags (system's has no .pc)

	Cannot run volume-monitor test as nobody because monitor
	daemon is owned by logged in user, or at all because we don't
	have a functional gvfs-hal-volume-monitor

	Fails self-tests in gobject/signals on 10.6/i386 (passes on
	x86_64). See:
	https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=677534

	BDep:coreutils for gnu readlink for ./configure. See:
	https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=606872
	https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=640834

	Fink's elf-0.8.9-2 is not sufficient and elf is not necessary,
	so disable its detection.

	Fix constant type in utils.c. See:
	https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=688829

	Not bothering to fix unused-variable warning in gunixmounts.c
	because darwin doesn't seem to have vfs.usermount anyway. See:
	https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=689324
