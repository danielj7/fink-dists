Description: Alternate Window Manager
DescDetail: <<
AfterStep is a window manager for the X Window System. It was started
to emulate the look and feel of NeXTSTEP(tm), but has evolved into
something that while still being able to emulate NeXT, can do much much
more. Without using much memory or cpu time, AfterStep provides all the
features one could want in a window manager.
