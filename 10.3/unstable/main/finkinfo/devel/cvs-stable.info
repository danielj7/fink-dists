Description: Version control system
DescDetail: <<
 CVS is the Concurrent Versions System, the dominant open-source
 network-transparent version control system. CVS is useful for
 everyone from individual developers to large, distributed teams:
	- Its client-server access method lets developers access the
	  latest code from anywhere there's an Internet connection.
	- Its unreserved check-out model to version control avoids
	  artificial conflicts common with the exclusive check-out model.
	- Its client tools are available on most platforms.
This is the most recent (as of 1/15/06) version in the upstream "stable" tree
and is provided mainly for Panther users to have a reliable fallback.

 "Enabling this on a case insensitive system should
  have little effect on the server or client
  operation":  from the help text in the configure script.
Uses system's OpenSSL.
