DescPort: <<
libtool not used, so links for shared library had to be created manually
and test applications taken out of bin/.libs/ libtool folder
copied doc files manually
Fixed syntax of link flags in portaudio-2.0.pc: "-framework X" -> "-Wl,-framework,X"

dmacks ripped out universal-build bits...it's not portable in fink

using tar snapshot as latest release is from 2011.
