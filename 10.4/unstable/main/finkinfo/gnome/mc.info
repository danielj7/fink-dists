# DISCLAIMER: Max Horn is the sole maintainer of this package.
# Please DO NOT MAKE MODIFICATIONS without informing the maintainer.
# Preferably, send a patch to me instead of making changes yourself!
# If that is not possible due to extra urgency, at least send me a mail.
#
# Explanation: I am sick and tired of getting back to my packages and
# discovering that people have messed with it. I am then forced to
# retrace their steps, find out who, when and why did make a certain
# change etc. -- i.e. it makes my life as maintainer harder.
# Furthermore, as maintainer I am responsible for problems caused by my
# packages. But I am not willing to take responsibility for something I
# did not do. In particular, for changes that other people introduced
# behind my back, no matter how good and noble their intentions were. As
# such, I may see myself forced to drop responsibility for (and hence,
# maintainership of) the affected package.

Description: Midnight Commander File Manager
DescDetail: <<
The Midnight Commander is modeled after the famous
Norton Commander file manager.
<<
DescPort: <<
Disable use of grantpt() for subshells on 10.4 -- apparently this
syscall is either buggy or not compatible with mc in some way. 
See bug #1336933.

Previous versions by Christoph Pfisterer.
<<
DescUsage: <<
If the function keys don't work in the terminal version, try the
sequence Esc-<number>, e.g. Esc-0 for F10.
