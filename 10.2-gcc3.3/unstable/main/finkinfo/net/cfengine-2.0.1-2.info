Description: Configuration engine for computers and networks 
Homepage: http://www.cfengine.org
DescDetail: <<
Cfengine is a tool for setting up and maintaining computer systems optionally 
attached to a TCP/IP network.

The idea behind cfengine is to focus upon a few key areas of basic system
administration and provide a language in which the transparency of a
configuration program is optimal. It eliminates the need for lots of tests by
allowing you to organize your network according to "classes".  From a single
configuration file (or set of files) you can specify how your network should be
configured -- and cfengine will then parse your file and carry out the
instructions, warning or fixing errors as it goes.

Cfengine incorporates a declarative language--much higher level than Perl or
shell:  a single statement can result in many hundreds of operations being
performed on multiple hosts.  Cfengine is good at performing a lot of common
system administration tasks, and allows you to build on its strengths with your
own scripts. You can also use it as a netwide front-end for cron.  Once you 
have set up cfengine, you'll be free to use your time being like a human being,
instead of playing R2-D2 with the system.

Cfengine is written mainly by Mark Burgess at Oslo University College in Norway.

DescPackaging: <<
We don't need to patch the C source files, thanks to OS X testing of the 
beta releases.

We need configure parameters and a configure.ac patch so that the 
we can link to the openssl and Berkeley DB libraries and copy the info and 
man files to Fink's locations.  Autoconf 2.52 is needed to regenerate the 
configure script after patching configure.ac.
