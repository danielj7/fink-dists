Description: Data processing and 2-D visualization tool
DescDetail: <<
Grace is a Motif/Lesstif application for two-dimensional data
visualization. Grace can transform the data using free equations, FFT,
cross- and auto-correlation, differences, integrals, histograms, and
much more. The generated figures are of high quality. Grace is a very
convenient tool for data inspection, data transformation, and for
making figures for publications.

Configure test for isnan_decl fails on 10.2 - patch includes config.cache
to force the issue.
Patch to doc/Makefile to force install of man pages in %p/share/man.

Although this package is distributed under the GPL, fink's compilation links
to the (static) pdflib library, which is restricted (but which can be
distributed in this way).  For this reason, the grace package is labelled
as Restrictive/Distributable.
