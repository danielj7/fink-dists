vcp - Version CoPy

vcp (and the Perl module VCP.pm) is a system for copying resources
under version control between repositories. cvs, p4 and RevML files
are currently supported.

vcp can re-root directory hierarchies diring the transfer, and,
using source specifications, or by filtering RevML files, subsets of
files and revisions may be copied.

Both whole-repository and incremental updates are supported.
<<
DescPort: <<
A lot of tests fail, partly due to the fact that p4 is not installed and not
yet ported to 10.3 yet. Asked upstream.
