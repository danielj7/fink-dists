Package: latexdiff
Version: 0.5
Revision: 2
Description: Compare latex files and markup differences
DescDetail: <<
latexdiff is a Perl script, which compares two latex files and marks
up significant differences between them (i.e. a diff for latex files).
Various options are available for visual markup using standard latex 
packages such as "color.sty". Changes not directly affecting visible 
text, for example in formatting commands, are still marked in 
the latex source.

A rudimentary revision facilility is provided by another Perl script,
latexrevise, which accepts or rejects all changes.  Manual
editing of the difference file can be used to override this default
behaviour and accept or reject selected changes only.
