Package: wsmake
Version: 0.6.5pre1
Revision: 1
Description: Website pre-processor and build tool
DescDetail: <<
Wsmake is a website make tool for website development and maintenance.
It features tag substitution, page ordering, and 'make'-like dependency
checking.
<<
DescPort: <<
Apple Developer Tools is GNUish, so I don't know why __GNU_LIBRARY__
isn't defined, but it needs to be so that GNU getopt.h (which this
package needs) doesn't conflict with the unistd.h declaration of
getopt().

I'm not using --with-docbook-tools since that would drag in a *lot* of
BuildDepends, there's already some plaintext documentation and examples. 

I'm not using --with-iwsmake since it depends on libtui, the source for
which is not included nor could I find via Google.

DescUsage: Read the manual examples in share/doc/wsmake.
