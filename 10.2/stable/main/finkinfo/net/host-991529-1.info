Description: Enhanced DNS and ns/mx/rblookup utilities.
DescDetail: <<
New "host" features are:
 o  Extensive error checking.
 o  Optionally (very) verbose output and debugging info.
 o  Checking for extraneous conditions during zone listings
    such as non-authoritative glue records and lame delegations.
 o  Checking for illegal characters in certain domain names.
 o  Checking for dangling CNAME pointers without RR records.
 o  Verify that some host-related domain names are canonical.
 o  Perform ttl consistency checking during zone listings.
 o  Recursive traversion of delegated zones up to a given level.
 o  Maintaining of resource record and host count statistics.
 o  Option to check reverse mappings of host addresses.
 o  Option to compare SOA records at the primary and secondary
    nameservers of a zone to check for anomalies such as
    out-of-sync serial numbers, and other discrepancies.
 o  Recognition of many new RR types as defined by latest RFCs.
 o  Allow multiple arguments on command line or from stdin.
 o  Configurable default options via an environment variable.
 o  Anticipate non-BIND behaviour during zone listings.
 o  Facility to maintain local disk cache files for zone data.
Includes "nslookup" and "mxlookup" host wrapper scripts, and an 
"rblookup" script to look up blackholed domains on ORBS/MAPS, but 
ORBS and MAPS are gone.

Conflict with bind since it comes with nslookup and host.
