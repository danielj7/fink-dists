Description: Perl extension for the GNU Readline/History Library
DescDetail: <<
This is a quick implementation of the minimal interface to Readline
libraries. The implementation is made in Perl (mostly) by Jeffrey
Friedl. The only thing this library does is to make it conformant (and
add some minimal changes, like using Term::ReadKey if present, and
correct work under xterm).
