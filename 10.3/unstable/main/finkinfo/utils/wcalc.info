Description: Command-line calculator
DescDetail: <<
Wcalc is a very capable command-line calculator (also has a Cocoa GUI version).
It has standard functions (sin, asinh, and sqrt for example, in either radians
or degrees), many pre-defined constants (pi, e, c, G, etc.), support for using
variables, "active" variables, a command history, hex/octal/binary input and
output, unit conversions, embedded comments, and the ability to save history to
a file and load it from a file. Wcalc evaluates expressions using the standard
order of operations.

Wcalc uses intuitive expressions. For example, Wcalc will evaluate
5sin 4!-7*2(4%6)^2 to be -221.96631678.
