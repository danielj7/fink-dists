Description: Parallel URL Fetcher
DescDetail: << 
puf is a tool that can be used to download single files or mirror entire servers. 
It is similar to GNU wget (and has a partly-compatible command line), but has the 
ability to do many downloads in parallel. 
This is very useful if you have a high-bandwidth Internet connection.
