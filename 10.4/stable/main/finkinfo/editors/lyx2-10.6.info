Description: Wordprocessor utilizing LaTeX
DescDetail: <<
LyX is a modern approach of writing documents with a computer
which breaks with the tradition of the obsolete typewriter
concept.  It is designed for people who want a professional
output with a minimum of time and effort, without becoming specia-
lists in typesetting.  Compared to common word processors LyX
will increase the productivity a lot, since most of the type-
setting will be done by the computer, not the author.  With LyX
the author can concentrate on the contents of his writing,
since the computer will take care of the look.
<<
DescUsage: <<
If you're using a non-Fink TeX distro, you'll want to run

/path/to/mktexlsr %p/etc/texmf.local
after installation of the package, and also after removing it, 
to integrate its style and class files with your TeX setup.

Since LyX is highly configurable at runtime, we've moved to
having recommended rather than mandatory dependencies on
Imagemagick, TeX, and Postscript and PDF viewers.  Some users
may already have non-Fink options for these and so we won't
force extra packages upon them.
<<
DescPort: <<
Thanks to Ronald Florence for his instructions on getting
lyx-1.3.2 to compile (http://www.18james.com/lyx_on_osx.html)

Symlink to the real mkinstalldirs as a simple workaround to the 
Makefile trying to find one in %b rather than %b/config.
<<
DescPackaging:  <<
Uses by-hand installation of the app bundle rather than AppBundles
so that the -mac and -x11 packages can be described in one .info file.

The -mac and -x11 variants don't have any files that overlap, so they
don't conflict/replace each other.

Since we're using the system's python to avoid extra dependencies, we
force a rebuild for a 10.4 -> 10.5, 10.5 -> 10.6, or 10.6->10.7 update.

Uses Fink's boost as of 1.6.5-22 and later.

lyx is a wrapper script that sets up symlinks to latex-xft fonts
fonts in ~/.fonts, so that LyX will find them.

Since we pretty much have to set the prefix to build the .app
bundle we have to reconstitute the python modules by hand in the 
Aqua version or the validator gripes.

The X11 version creates %i/Contents, which isn't on the list of
approved directories.  Manually move that into %i/share/lyx.

The X11 variant tries to install .lproj/ directories directly in %p, 
so we patch development/MacOSX/Makefile.in to avoid that.
