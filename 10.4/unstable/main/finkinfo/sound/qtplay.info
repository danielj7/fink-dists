Description: Play CDs and music files using QuickTime
DescDetail: <<
 qtplay is a Quicktime audio player for the command line. Arguments
 can be audio file names, directories containing audio files or the
 path to those files. Since qtplay uses Apple's QuickTime it supports
 all audio file formats that are supported by QuickTime.
