Description: Data for VTK
DescDetail: << 
 This package contains data and baseline images for VTK regression testing
 and other VTK examples. (See
 http://www.vtk.org/testing/TestingResults/Dashboard/MostRecentResults-Nightly/Dashboard.html
 to see how regression testing is used.) 
 Also see http://public.kitware.com/Dart
 to learn about the Dart regression testing system.
 
 The VTKData/Data directory are data files of various types. This includes
 polygonal data, images, volumes, structured grids, rectilinear grids,
 and multi-variate data.
 
 The VTKData/Baseline are the testing images. These are used in testing to
 compare a valid image against a generated image. If a difference between the
 two images is found, then the test is considered to have failed.
<<
DescUsage: <<
 This version uses X11 and Fink's Tcl/Tk.
 Examples are provided in the share/doc/vtk/Examples folder.
 To run them, use "wish Tutorial/Step1/Tcl/Cone.tcl", for example. 
 For documentation see the vtk web site.
