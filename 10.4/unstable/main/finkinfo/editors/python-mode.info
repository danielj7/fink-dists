DescDetail: <<
This is a major mode for editing Python programs.  It was developed by Tim
Peters after an original idea by Michael A. Guravage.  Tim subsequently
left the net and in 1995, Barry Warsaw inherited the mode.  Tim's now back
but disavows all responsibility for the mode.  In fact, we suspect he
doesn't even use Emacs any more.  In 2003, python-mode.el was moved to its
own SourceForge project apart from the Python project, and now is
maintained by the volunteers at the python-mode@python.org mailing list.

DescUsage: <<
