Description: Simple Authentication and Security Layer framework 
DescDetail: <<
GNU SASL is an implementation of the Simple Authentication and Security Layer
framework and a few common SASL mechanisms. SASL is used by network servers 
(e.g., IMAP, SMTP) to request authentication from clients, and in clients to 
authenticate against servers.

GNU SASL contains a library (libgsasl), a command line utility (gsasl) to access
the library from the shell, and a manual. The library includes support for the 
SASL framework (with authentication functions and application data privacy and
integrity functions) and at least partial support for the CRAM-MD5, EXTERNAL,
GSSAPI, ANONYMOUS, PLAIN, SECURID, DIGEST-MD5, LOGIN, NTLM and KERBEROS_V5 mechanisms.

The library is portable because it does not do network communication by itself, 
but rather leaves it up to the calling application. The library is flexible with
regards to the authorization infrastructure used, as it utilizes callbacks into 
the application to decide whether an user is authorized or not.

GNU SASL is written in pure ANSI C89 to be portable to embedded and otherwise limited
platforms. The entire library, with full support for ANONYMOUS, EXTERNAL, PLAIN, LOGIN
and CRAM-MD5, and the front-end that support client and server mode, and the IMAP 
and SMTP protocols, fits in under 60kb on an Intel x86 platform, without 
any modifications to the code.
