Description: Automatic software build/test system

DescDetail: <<
The BuildBot is a system to automate the compile/test cycle required by most
software projects to validate code changes. By automatically rebuilding and
testing the tree each time something has changed, build problems are pinpointed
quickly, before other developers are inconvenienced by the failure. The guilty
developer can be identified and harassed without human intervention. By running
the builds on a variety of platforms, developers who do not have the facilities
to test their changes everywhere before checkin will at least know shortly
afterwards whether they have broken the build or not. Warning counts, lint
checks, image size, compile time, and other build parameters can be tracked
over time, are more visible, and are therefore easier to improve.

The overall goal is to reduce tree breakage and provide a platform to run tests
or code-quality checks that are too annoying or pedantic for any human to waste
their time with. Developers get immediate (and potentially public) feedback
about their changes, encouraging them to be more careful about testing before
checkin.

It is suggested that you start buildbot from launchd:

DescPackaging:<<
This package should eventually provide a system user to isolate the builds.
