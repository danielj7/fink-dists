Description: Python HTTP for Humans

DescDetail: <<
	Requests is an Apache2 Licensed HTTP library, written in Python, for
	human beings.

	Most existing Python modules for sending HTTP requests are extremely
	verbose and cumbersome. Python's builtin urllib2 module provides
	most of the HTTP capabilities you should need, but the api is
	thoroughly broken. It requires an enormous amount of work (even
	method overrides) to perform the simplest of tasks.
