DescDetail: << 
SWF Tools is a collection of SWF manipulation and 
creation utilities written by Rainer Bohme 
and Matthias Kramm. Included are: PDF2SWF, SWFCombine, etc...
<<
DescPort: <<
Detects ruby but doesn't actually use it.  Let's give it something consistent.

Detects python, and tries to find Python-imaging (PIL), but fails, even with Fink's,
so let's make sure we stay with system-python, which it doesn't use anyway.

Fails with libjpeg9 with undeclared TRUE and FALSE, so copy in #defines from
libjpeg's jmorecfg.h (which should be getting #defined, but somehow are not)

Upstream mailing-list has patch for new giflib. See:
https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/swftools-common/2013-06/msg00004.html
But not sufficient for latest. Instead use pld-linux's. See:
