DescDetail: <<
Nightfall can produce animated views of eclipsing binary stars, calculate synthetic 
lightcurves and radial velocity curves , and eventually determine the best-fit 
model for a given set of observational data of an eclipsing binary star system. 

Nightfall is based on a physical 
model that takes into account the nonspherical shape of stars in close 
binary systems, as well as mutual irradiance of both stars, and a number 
of additional physical effects. 

Nightfall can handle a large range of configurations, including 
overcontact (common envelope) systems, eccentric  (non-circular) orbits, 
surface spots and asynchroneous rotation (stars rotating slower or faster 
than the orbital period), and the possible existence of a third star in 
the system ('third light').
