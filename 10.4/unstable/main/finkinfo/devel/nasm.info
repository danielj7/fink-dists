DescDetail: <<
	The Netwide Assembler, NASM, is an 80x86 and x86-64 assembler designed
	for portability and modularity. It supports a range of object file
	formats, including Linux and *BSD a.out, ELF, COFF, Mach-O, Microsoft
	16-bit OBJ, Win32 and Win64. It will also output plain binary files.
	Its syntax is designed to be simple and easy to understand, similar to
	Intel's but less complex. It supports all currently known x86
	architectural extensions, and has strong support for macros.
	
	This version fully supports i386 and x86_64 code generation.
	The version included with Xcode only does i386.
