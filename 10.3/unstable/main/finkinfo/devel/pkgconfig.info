Description: Manager for library compile/link flags
DescDetail: <<
pkg-config is a script to make putting together all the build
flags when compiling/linking a lot easier.
<<
DescUsage: <<
Version 0.20 adds support for *.private fields in .pc files. Older
versions ignore them and most fink packages that use pkg-config do not
need them. However, packages supplying .pc that have them should take
steps to ensure users who might need them don't accidentally use a
lower version of pkgconfig and thus get deficient flags.
<<
DescPort: <<
  X11 provides some .pc files in /usr/X11R6/lib/pkgconfig, so this
  directory was added to default search path.

  Default search is now (0.17.2) %p/lib/pkgconfig:%p/share/pkgconfig,
  however, the previous version of this package (0.15.0) used lib/ not
  share/. We adjust the search paths to maintain the old behavior for
  drop-in compatibility.

  Starting with 0.17.2, Link to Fink's glib pkg instead of static-link
  to included glib-1.2.8 since we have newer and better-OSX-tweaked
  glib than that now.

  Omitting --enable-indirect-deps gives a binary that gives identical
  results for --libs and --cflags for the fink-supplied pkgconfig/*.pc
  collection as 0.17.2-2 (with --enable-indirect-deps), including ones
  that have Requires and ones that have .private fields. The binary
  still fails some tests (appears to do depth-first recursing through
  Requires but expects breadth-first), so we disable those.

  Upstream seems rather disinterested in solving this self-test mess.
