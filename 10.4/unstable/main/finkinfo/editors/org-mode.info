DescDetail: <<
Org is a mode for keeping notes, maintaining TODO lists, and doing
project planning with a fast and effective plain-text system.

Org develops organizational tasks around NOTES files that contain
lists or information about projects as plain text.  Org is implemented
on top of Outline mode, which makes it possible to keep the content of
large files well structured.  Visibility cycling and structure editing
help to work with the tree.  Tables are easily created with a built-in
table editor.  Org supports TODO items, deadlines, time stamps, and
scheduling.  It dynamically compiles entries into an agenda that
utilizes and smoothly integrates much of the Emacs calendar and diary.
Plain text URL-like links connect to websites, emails, Usenet
messages, BBDB entries, and any files related to the projects.  For
printing and sharing of notes, an Org file can be exported as a
structured ASCII file, as HTML, or (TODO and agenda items only) as an
iCalendar file.  It can also serve as a publishing tool for a set of
linked web pages.

An important design aspect that distinguishes Org from for example
Planner/Muse is that it encourages to store every piece of information
only once.  In Planner, you have project pages, day pages and possibly
other files, duplicating some information such as tasks.  In Org, you
only have notes files.  In your notes you mark entries as tasks, label
them with tags and timestamps.  All necessary lists like a schedule
for the day, the agenda for a meeting, tasks lists selected by tags
etc are created dynamically when you need them.

Org keeps simple things simple.  When first fired up, it should feel
like a straightforward, easy to use outliner.  Complexity is not
imposed, but a large amount of functionality is available when you
need it.  Org is a toolbox and can be used in different ways, for
example as:

* outline extension with visibility cycling and structure editing
* ASCII system and table editor for taking structured notes
* ASCII table editor with spreadsheet-like capabilities
* TODO list editor
* full agenda and planner with deadlines and work scheduling
* environment to implement David Allen's GTD system
* a basic database application
* simple hypertext system, with HTML and LaTeX export
* publishing tool to create a set of interlinked webpages

Org's automatic, context sensitive table editor with spreadsheet
capabilities can be integrated into any major mode by activating the
minor Orgtbl mode.  Using a translation step, it can be used to
maintain tables in arbitrary file types, for example in LaTeX.  The
structure editing and list creation capabilities can be used outside
Org with the minor Orgstruct mode.

DescUsage: <<
The upstream author of org-mode suggests that you assign global
keybindings to the org-mode commands `org-store-link', `org-agenda'
and `org-iswitchb'.  This can be accomplished by adding the following
two forms to your `.emacs' file; they define global keys for the
commands `org-store-link' and `org-agenda'.  Clearly, the precise keys
you use are not important, and these are but suggestions; choose
suitable keys for yourself.

  (global-set-key "\C-cl" 'org-store-link)
  (global-set-key "\C-ca" 'org-agenda)
  (global-set-key "\C-cb" 'org-iswitchb)

By default, the org-mode fink package has set up emacs to load
org-mode whenever a file whose extension is ".org" is encountered.  To
manually enable org-mode in an emacs buffer, issue the command
`org-mode'.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
As mentioned in the DescUsage field, the upstream maintainer
recommends adding a few keybindings.  I thought it would be unwise to
add those to 50org.el, the file that is automatically loaded upon
emacs startup and which loads org-mode, because adding global bindings
seems to me to be too much of an intrusion.  That is why I refrained
from making defaults out of them and instead describe the keys in 
DescUsage.
