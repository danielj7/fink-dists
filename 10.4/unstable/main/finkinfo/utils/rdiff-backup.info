DescDetail: <<
rdiff-backup backs up one directory to another, possibly over a
network.  The target directory ends up a copy of the source directory,
but extra reverse diffs are stored in a special subdirectory of that
target directory, so you can still recover files lost some time ago.
The idea is to combine the best features of a mirror and an
incremental backup.  rdiff-backup also preserves subdirectories, hard
links, dev files, permissions, uid/gid ownership, and modification
times.  Also, rdiff-backup can operate in a bandwidth efficient manner
over a pipe, like rsync.  Thus you can use rdiff-backup and ssh to
securely back a hard drive up to a remote location, and only the
differences will be transmitted.  Finally, rdiff-backup is easy to use
and settings have sensible defaults.
