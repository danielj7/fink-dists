DescDetail: <<
Prefuse supports a rich set of features for data modeling, visualization, and
interaction. It provides optimized data structures for tables, graphs, and
trees, a host of layout and visual encoding techniques, and support for
animation, dynamic queries, integrated search, and database connectivity.
Prefuse is written in Java, using the Java 2D graphics library, and is easily
integrated into Java Swing applications or web applets. Prefuse is licensed
under the terms of a BSD license, and can be freely used for both commercial
and non-commercial purposes.
