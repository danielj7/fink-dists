Description:  Portable temporary file and directory support
DescDetail: <<
The functions for creating temporary files and directories in the base
library are quite limited. The unixutils package contains some good
ones, but they aren't portable to Windows. This library just
repackages the Cabal implementations of its own temporary file and
folder functions so that you can use them without linking against
Cabal or depending on it being installed.
