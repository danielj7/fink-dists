Description: Norman Walsh's XSL DocBook stylesheets
DescDetail: <<
 XSL stylesheets for the DocBook DTD (they are also completely
 compatible with the DocBook DSSSL DTD and the Simplified DocBook DTD).
<<
DescUsage: <<
 Obviously you need the DocBook DTD.
 If you want to process SGML files, you need also openjade and 
 probably both lpd and Norman Walsh dsssl stylesheets.
 Then if you want to use xsltproc, you have all installed already.
 If you want to use Saxon, you need to install it, and optionally
 (but recommanded) Xerces, which provides additional features. 
 The documentation is installed in %p/share/doc/docbook-xsl.
 This release brings numerous changes and improvements to the 
 stylesheets, as well as new extensions; especially to the
 production of man pages and pdf files. It is therefore strongly
 recommanded to read the RELEASE-NOTES provided in various formats
 and located in %p/share/doc/docbook-xsl.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
 The stylesheets are installed in %p/share/xml/xsl/docbook-xsl/ to
 allow installation of other stylesheet packages in %p/share/xml/xsl/
<<
DescPort: <<
Previous maintainer Thomas Kotzian <thomas.kotzian@gmx.at>
Adding proper prefix to rm, cp, cat, and install so that there is no
problem with other versions of those tools installed elsewhere.
Patched the local catalog as it refers incorrectly to version 
1.70.1
Added documentation
