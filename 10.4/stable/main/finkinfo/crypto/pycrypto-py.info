Description: Python Cryptographic Toolkit
DescDetail: <<
 The Toolkit is a collection of cryptographic algorithms and
 protocols, implemented for use from Python. This is a collection of
 both secure hash functions (such as SHA256 and RIPEMD160), and
 various encryption algorithms (AES, DES, RSA, ElGamal, etc.).  The
 package is structured to make adding new modules easy.  This section
 is essentially complete, and the software interface will almost
 certainly not change in an incompatible way in the future; all that
 remains to be done is to fix any bugs that show up.
 
 Among the contents of the package:
    * Hash functions: MD2, MD4, RIPEMD, SHA256.
    * Block encryption algorithms: AES, ARC2, Blowfish, 
       CAST, DES, Triple-DES, IDEA, RC5.
    * Stream encryption algorithms: ARC4, simple XOR.
    * Public-key algorithms: RSA, DSA, ElGamal, qNEW.
    * Protocols: All-or-nothing transforms, 
       chaffing/winnowing.
    * Miscellaneous: RFC1751 module for converting 
       128-key keys into a set of English words, 
       primality testing.
    * Some demo programs (currently all quite old and 
       outdated).
