DescDetail: <<
Stegdetect is an automated tool for detecting steganographic content
in images.  It is capable of detecting several different
steganographic methods to embed hidden information in JPEG images.
Currently, the detectable schemes are jsteg, jphide (unix and windows), 
invisible secrets, outguess 01.3b, F5 (header analysis), appendX and
camouflage. Stegbreak is used to launch dictionary attacks against
JSteg-Shell, JPHide and OutGuess 0.13b.

###
DescUsage: <<
There are man pages for stegdetect and stegbreak. If you wish
to try stegbreak on the first steganographic image found in the wild
(at http://www.citi.umich.edu/u/provos/stego/abc.html), make sure "abc"
is in your dictionary.

###
DescPort: <<
Patched file/Makefile.in to add -no-cpp-precomp to CPPFLAGS. Patched Makefile.in 
to remove -static from stegbreak build. CFLAGS set to -no-cpp-precomp to avoid an 
"illegal instruction" while running "stegbreak -tj myjpeg.jpg"

rev. 11 (dmrrsn): We don't need the GCC flag since g++ is not called, but
if we *did* need it, its value would be 3.1 (since we explicitly call gcc3,
setting the compiler to gcc3.1 rather than gcc3.3).
