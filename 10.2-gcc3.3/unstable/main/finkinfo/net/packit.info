Description: Network auditing tool
DescDetail: <<
Packit is a network auditing tool. Its value is derived from its ability 
to customize, inject, monitor, and manipulate IP traffic. By allowing 
you to define (spoof) nearly all TCP, UDP, ICMP, IP, ARP, RARP, and 
Ethernet header options, Packit can be useful in testing firewalls, 
intrusion detection systems, port scanning, simulating network traffic, 
and general TCP/IP auditing. Packit is also an excellent tool for 
learning TCP/IP.
