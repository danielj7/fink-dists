DescDetail: <<
FindBugs is a program to find bugs in Java programs.  It looks for
instances of "bug patterns" --- code instances that are likely to be
errors.

Changes since version 0.8.7:

 - New detector to find duplicate code in if/else statements (Dave
   Brosius)
 - Look for calls to wait() on Condition objects (David Hovemeyer)
 - Look for java.util.concurrent.Lock objects not released on every
   path out of method (David Hovemeyer)
 - Look for calls to Thread.sleep() with a lock held (David Hovemeyer)
 - More accurate detection of impossible casts (Bill Pugh, David
   Hovemeyer)
 - Saved XML now contains project statistics (Jay Dunning)
 - Filter files can select by bug pattern type and warning priority
   (David Hovemeyer)
 - Restored some files inadvertently omitted from previous release
   (Rohan Lloyd, David Hovemeyer)
 - Make sure detectors requiring JDK 1.5 runtime classes are only
   executed if those classes are available (David Hovemeyer)
 - Don't display analysis error dialog unless there is really an error
   (David Hovemeyer)
 - Updated and expanded French translations of bug patterns and Swing
   GUI (Olivier Parent)
 - Fixed invalid character encoding in German Swing GUI translation
   (Olivier Parent)
 - Fix locale used for date format in project stats (K. Hashimoto)
 - Fixed LongDescription elements in xml:withMessages output format
   (K. Hashimoto)

Changes since version 0.8.6:

- Extend Naming detector to look for classes that are named
  XXXException but that are not Exceptions (Dave Brosius)
- New detector to find classes that expose semaphores in the public
  implementation through the 'this' reference. (Dave Brosius)
- New Style detector to find Struts Action/Servlet derived classes
  that reference instance member variable not in synchronized
  blocks. (Dave Brosius)
- New Style detector to find classes that declare implementation of
  interfaces that are already implemented by super classes (Dave
  Brosius)
- New Style detector to find circular dependencies between classes
  (Dave Brosius)
- New Style detector to find unnecessary math on constants (Dave Brosius)
- New detector to find equality comparisons using floating point math
  (Jay Dunning)
- New faster detector to find local self assignments (Bill Pugh)
- New detector to find infinite recursive loops (Bill Pugh)
- New detector to find for loops with an incorrect increment (Bill Pugh)
- New detector to find suspicious uses of BufferedReader.readLine()
  and String.indexOf() (Bill Pugh)
- New detector to find suspicious integer to double casts (David
  Hovemeyer, Bill Pugh)
- New detector to find invalid regular expression patterns (Bill Pugh)
- New detector to find Bloch/Gafter Java puzzlers (Bill Pugh)
- New system property to suppress reporting of DLS based on local
  variable name (Glenn Boysko)
- Enhancements to configuration dialog in Eclipse plugin, allow for
  saving enabled detectors in Eclipse projects (Phil Crosby)
- Sortable columns in detector dialog (Dave Brosius)
- New tab in gui for showing bugs grouped by category (Dave Brosius)
- Improved German translation of Swing GUI (Thomas Kuehne)
- Improved source file reporting in Emacs output format (Len Trigg)
- Improvements to redundant null comparison detector (Bill Pugh)
- Localization of run analysis and analysis error dialogs in Swing GUI
  (K. Hashimoto)
- Don't scan equals methods in FindHEMismatch if code is native (Greg
  Bentz)
- French translation fixes (David Cotton)
- Internationalization report fixes (K. Hashimoto)
- Japanese translations updates (SHISEI Hanai)

Findbugs itself is release under the LGPL, however the shell scripts that
launch the program contain some code subject to the Apache Software
