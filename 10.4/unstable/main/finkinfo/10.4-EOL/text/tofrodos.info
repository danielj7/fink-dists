DescDetail: <<
Tofrodos is a text file conversion utility that converts ASCII files
between the MSDOS (or Windows) format, which traditionally have CR/LF
(carriage return/line feed) pairs as their new line delimiters, and the
Unix format, which usually have LFs (line feeds) to terminate each line.
<<

DescUsage: <<
tofrodos converts text files between DOS and Unix formats.

Usage: todos [options] [file...]
-a	Always convert (DOS to Unix: kill all CRs;
	Unix to DOS: convert all LFs to CRLFs)
-b	Make backup of original file (.bak).
-d	Convert DOS to Unix.
-e	Abort processing files on error in any file.
-f	Force: convert even if file is not writeable.
-h	Display help on usage and quit.
-l file	Log most errors and verbose messages to <file>
-o	Overwrite original file (no backup).

-u	Convert Unix to DOS.
-v	Verbose.
