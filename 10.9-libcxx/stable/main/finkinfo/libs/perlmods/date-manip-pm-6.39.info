Package: date-manip-pm%type_pkg[perl]
Version: 6.39
Revision: 3
BuildDepends: fink (>= 0.32)
RuntimeDepends: <<
	date-manip-pm (>= %v-1),
	fink-obsolete-packages
<<
Type: perl (5.12.3 5.12.4), bundle
DescPackaging: <<
	Older versions in the 6.xx series had deps on perl-varianted
	packages, so date-manip-pmXXX was also varianted. Now that it
	only has unvarianted deps, no need to be varianted here
	either. The variant set is just a dummy bundle around the
	non-varianted package that contains the actual module.
