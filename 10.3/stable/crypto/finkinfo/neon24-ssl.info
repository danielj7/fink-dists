# Additionale Information:
DescDetail: <<
Current features:

 - High-level interface to HTTP and WebDAV methods (PUT, GET, HEAD etc)
 - Low-level interface to HTTP request handling, to allow implementing
   new methods easily.
 - persistent connections
 - RFC2617 basic and digest authentication (including auth-int, md5-sess)
 - Proxy support (including basic/digest authentication)
 - SSL/TLS support using OpenSSL (including client certificate support)
 - Generic WebDAV 207 XML response handling mechanism
 - XML parsing using the expat or libxml parsers
 - Easy generation of error messages from 207 error responses
 - WebDAV resource manipulation: MOVE, COPY, DELETE, MKCOL.
 - WebDAV metadata support: set and remove properties, query any set of
   properties (PROPPATCH/PROPFIND).
 - autoconf macros supplied for easily embedding neon directly inside an
   application source tree.

neon is licensed under the GNU LGPL; see COPYING.LIB for full details.

Please note that the neon API is not yet stable, and is subject to 
major changes
<<
DescPackaging: <<
 Although this package has a LGPL license, it is marked Restrictive since
 it links to openssl.

Patched so that it installs the html documentation into the default
doc folder.

Version 0.24.7 seems to use a buggy libtool. Patched configure so that
shared libraries are still built. Thanks to peter@pogma.com for the patch.
