Description: Norman Walsh's XSL DocBook stylesheets
DescDetail: <<
 XSL stylesheets for the DocBook DTD (they are also completely
 compatible with the DocBook DSSSL DTD and the Simplified DocBook  DTD).
<<
DescPackaging: <<
This package version installs the stylesheets in 
%p/share/xml/xsl/docbook-xsl/, compared to the previous version which
 installed directly in %p/share/xml/xsl/. This was done to be able to
 have other stylesheet packages in %p/share/xml/xsl/
<<
DescPort: <<
Adding proper prefix to rm, cp, cat, and install so that there is no
problem with other versions of those tools installed elsewhere.
