DescDetail: <<
Tools to assist in safely applying user-generated objective and derivative
functions to optimization programs. "Optimization" at the time of writing
refers primarily to function minimization methods with at most bounds and
masks on the parameters. Tools are provided to check the basic computation
of objective functions that the user provides, along with proposed gradient
and Hessian functions, as well as to wrap such functions to avoid failures
when inadmissible parameters are provided. Checks on bounds and masks
(fixed parameters) are available, as are a check on scaling or optimality
conditions. An axial search to seek lower points on the objective function
surface is included. Though numDeriv is used as the primary tool for
numerical derivative approximations, forward, central and backward
gradient approximation codes for convenience.
