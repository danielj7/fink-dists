Description: Tool for distributing files
DescDetail: <<
BitTorrent is a tool for distributing files. It's extremely easy to use -
downloads are started by clicking on hyperlinks. Whenever more than one person
is downloading at once they send pieces of the file(s) to each other, thus
relieving the central server's bandwidth burden. Even with many simultaneous
downloads, the upload burden on the central server remains quite small, since
each new downloader introduces new upload capacity.  This version has the X11
front-end enabled. For the version without X11 support, see 'bittorrent-nox'.
