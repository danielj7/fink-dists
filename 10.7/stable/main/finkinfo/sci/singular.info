# DISCLAIMER: Max Horn is the sole maintainer of this package.
# Please DO NOT MAKE MODIFICATIONS without informing the maintainer.
# Preferably, send a patch to me instead of making changes yourself!
# If that is not possible due to extra urgency, at least send me a mail.
#
# Explanation: I am sick and tired of getting back to my packages and
# discovering that people have messed with it. I am then forced to
# retrace their steps, find out who, when and why did make a certain
# change etc. -- i.e. it makes my life as maintainer harder.
# Furthermore, as maintainer I am responsible for problems caused by my
# packages. But I am not willing to take responsibility for something I
# did not do. In particular, for changes that other people introduced
# behind my back, no matter how good and noble their intentions were. As
# such, I may see myself forced to drop responsibility for (and hence,
# maintainership of) the affected package.

Description: Computer algebra system
DescDetail: <<
Singular is a computer algebra system for polynomial computations, with
special emphasis on commutative and non-commutative algebra, algebraic
geometry, and singularity theory. 

Its main computational objects are ideals, modules and matrices over a
large number of baserings.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
 Disabling MP on 64 bit as it requires sizeof(long)==4. 

 Patching libparse.{l,cc} to avoid error with strict C++ compilers.
 
 Add explict include for <stddef.h> to work around problems on 10.7
 caused by singular trying to "trick" GMP into thinking it is being
 compiled in a C compiler, not a C++ compiler.
