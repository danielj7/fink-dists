DescDetail: <<
NUT is a client/server uninterruptible power supply (UPS) monitoring system
that permits the sharing of one (or more) UPS between several machines.  The
'server' monitors the UPS and notifies the 'clients' when the UPS is on
battery or has a low battery.

If you have a serial UPS, you will need a USB-to-serial converter and OS X
drivers for the converter. (PalmConnect converters will not work with the
Palm-provided driver.) In this case, install the base "nut" package.

If your UPS connects via a USB cable, install the "nut-usb" package. This
covers most APC Back-UPS models, as well as MGE Ellipse, Comet, Nova,
Evolution, and Protection Center units. Some Belkin models may be supported.
Tripp Lite USB models that use newhidups (especially ones with LCD in their
name) should work, but the tripplite_usb driver currently cannot open
entry-level Tripp Lite USB devices.

To graphically view the status of your UPSes, install the "nut-cgi" package.
<<

DescUsage:<<
You will need to read the documentation in %p/share/doc/%n/docs to learn how to
set up NUT to monitor your UPS and shut down your machine when the UPS battery
is low.

Note that some USB UPSes may already be supported by OS X, and the NUT drivers
may have trouble interoperating.

DescPort:<<
I looked at making this work with net-snmp, but currently (July 2006) the
net-snmp in unstable does not compile, and there is no virtual package for the
Tiger net-snmp.
