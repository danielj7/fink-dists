Version: 1.2.5
Revision: 1
Type: python (2.5 2.6 2.7)
Description: Python wrapper for the GNUTLS library
DescDetail: <<
 This package provides a high level object oriented wrapper around
 libgnutls, as well as low level bindings to the GNUTLS types and
 functions via ctypes. The high level wrapper hides the details of
 accessing the GNUTLS library via ctypes behind a set of classes that
 encapsulate GNUTLS sessions, certificates and credentials and expose
 them to python applications using a simple API.

 The package also includes a Twisted interface that has seamless
 intergration with Twisted, providing connectTLS and listenTLS methods
 on the Twisted reactor once imported (the methods are automatically
 attached to the reactor by simply importing the GNUTLS Twisted
 interface module).

 The high level wrapper is written using the GNUTLS library bindings
 that are made available via ctypes. This makes the wrapper very
 powerful and flexible as it has direct access to all the GNUTLS
 internals and is also very easy to extend without any need to write C
 code or recompile anything.
