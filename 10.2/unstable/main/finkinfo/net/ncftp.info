Description: Browser program using ftp protocol
DescDetail: The purpose of ncftp is to provide a powerful and flexible
 interface to the Internet standard File Transfer Protocol.
 It is intended to replace the stock ftp program that comes
 with the system.
 Some of the cooler features include progress meters, file-
 name completion, command-line editing, background process-
 ing, auto-resume downloads, bookmarking, cached  directory
 listings, host redialing, working with firewalls and prox-
 ies, downloading entire directory trees, etc., etc.
