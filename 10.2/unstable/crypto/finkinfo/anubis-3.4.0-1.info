Description: Outgoing mail processor
DescDetail: <<
An outgoing mail processor, and the SMTP tunnel between the MUA
and the MTA. It operates as a proxy server daemon, independently from mail 
user agents, and can manage and process outgoing mail on the fly using a 
highly configurable rule system, based on a regular expressions (PerlRE) 
system. Anubis can edit outgoing mail headers, encrypt and/or sign mail with 
GnuPG, build secure SMTP tunnels using the TLS/SSL encryption even if your 
mail user agent doesn't support it, or tunnel a connection through a SOCKS 
proxy server.
