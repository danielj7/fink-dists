Description: VT102 emulator with multi-language support
DescDetail: <<
Mrxvt (previously named materm) is a lightweight, powerful multi-tabbed 
terminal emulator for the X window system, based on rxvt version 2.7.11 
CVS and aterm. 
It implements many useful features seen in some modern X terminal emulators 
(like gnome-terminal and konsole) but aims to be fast, lightweight and 
independent of standard toolkits or desktop environments (e.g. Gnome / KDE).
You may customize mrxvt by copying the mrxvt.sample file located in
%p/etc/mrxvt inside your home directory under filename .mrxvtrc
Apart from the man page, see the FAQ/Tips and tricks on the web site.
