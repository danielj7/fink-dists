DescDetail: <<
GNU GLOBAL is a source code tag system that works the same way across diverse
environments such as Emacs editor, Vi editor, Less viewer, Bash shell, various
web browsers, etc. You can locate specified objects such as functions, macros,
structs, classes in your source files and move there easily. It is useful for
hacking large projects which contain many sub-directories, many #ifdef and many
main() functions. It is similar to ctags or etags, but is different from them
at the point of independence of any editor.

Editor-specific GLOBAL files are located under %p/share/gtags.
