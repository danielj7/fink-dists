Description: Console based web browser (SSL-enabled)
DescDetail: <<
Lynx is a web browser that runs inside a terminal emulator,
e.g. Terminal.app or an xterm. It can't display graphics and also has
trouble with tables, but it can come in handy in some situations.

This package builds Lynx with SSL/https support. If you don't want
that, install the lynx package instead.
<<
DescPort: <<
Doesn't do color in Terminal.app and xterms; this can probably be
cured by adjusting the terminfo data.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
The Makefile for the message catalogs doesn't respect DESTDIR, we work
around that by setting the installation paths on the command line.

Putting lynx.cfg in etc/ and the documentation elsewhere is a problem
because the configure script uses libdir for both. Fortunately, only
the path to lynx.cfg is hardcoded into the executable. So we set
libdir to etc/ and override the doc and help directories in the
install step. The Makefile edits lynx.cfg on the fly in the install
step, so all paths are correct.

COPYING and COPYHEADER are symlinked from the help dir to the doc dir,
but using the full path (with the package build directory in it). We
correct that manually.
