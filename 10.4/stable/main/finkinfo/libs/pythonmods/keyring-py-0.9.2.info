Description: Store and access your passwords safely
DescDetail: <<
	The Python keyring lib provides a easy way to access the system keyring
	service from python. It can be used in any application that needs safe
	password storage.
	
	The keyring services supported by the Python keyring lib:
	
	OSXKeychain: supports the Keychain service in Mac OS X.
	KDEKWallet: supports the KDE's Kwallet service.
	GnomeKeyring: for Gnome environment.
	
	Besides these native password storing services provided by operating
	systems. Python keyring lib also provides following build-in keyrings.
	
	Win32CryptoKeyring: for Windows 2k+.
	CryptedFileKeyring: a command line interface keyring base on PyCrypto.
	UncryptedFileKeyring: a keyring which leaves passwords directly in
	file.
<<
DescUsage: <<
	OSXKeychain and UncryptedFileKeyring are always supported, with
	OSXKeychain as the default. Install pycrypto-py%type_pkg[python]
	to enable CryptedFileKeyring and gnome-python2-desktop-py%type_pkg[python]
	for GnomeKeyring support. KDEKWallet isn't currently supported and
	Win32CryptoKeyring, of course, isn't either.
