Package: system-viha
Version: 0.0.1a
Revision: 4
Architecture: powerpc
Type: bundle
Description: Placeholder for Viha WiFi framework
DescDetail: <<
Install this package if you have manually installed the Viha WiFi
framework, which is available as a precompiled binary from:
  http://www.dopesquad.net/security/Viha-0.0.1a.tar.gz
Follow the therein-enclosed README file for installation instructions.
<<
DescPort: <<
The visible version info (Info.plist) is only "0.0.1", and nothing
anywhere mentions the "a" patchlevel. 

The "a" patchlevel claims to fix something in IEEE80211Frame so
checking md5 of the WiFi binary should make sure we have the right
version.
