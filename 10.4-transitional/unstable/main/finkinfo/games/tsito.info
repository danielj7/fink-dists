Description: Engine for Xiangqi (Chinese Chess)
DescDetail: <<
A Chinese Chess engine, designed to work with CXBoard.

The TSITO Chinese Chess Engine is the first of its kind; it was
designed to be able to communicate to interfaces (graphical or
otherwise) through a standard protocol. All other Chinese Chess
engines that the author is aware of were designed with the interface
embedded into the engine or to communicate through an undocumented set
of commands. There are numerous advantages to keeping the interface
separate from the engine; for instance, an engine author need not
concern themselves with major usability concerns so long as the
engine is conformant since these problems are taken care of.
