Description: SSL/TLS enabled replacement for standard FTP tool
DescDetail: <<
This is a a port of the OpenBSD FTP tool, with added support for
SSL/TLS, using the OpenSSL library.  Server support for this is still
emerging, but several servers have support for it available.  These
include Peter Runestig's matching ftpd-tls version of the OpenBSD
ftpd server and ProFTPd, available as a patch from Peter Runestig.
This ftp tool also includes editline/history support and a progress
indicator.
