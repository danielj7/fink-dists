Description: Copies data between file/block devices
DescDetail: <<
GNU ddrescue is a data recovery tool. It copies data from one file
or block device (hard disc, cdrom, etc) to another, trying hard to
rescue data in case of read errors.

Ddrescue does not truncate the output file if not asked to. So,
every time you run it on the same output file, it tries to fill in the gaps.

The basic operation of ddrescue is fully automatic. That is, you don't
have to wait for an error, stop the program, read the log, run it in reverse
mode, etc.

If you use the logfile feature of ddrescue, the data is rescued very
efficiently (only the needed blocks are read). Also you can interrupt the
rescue at any time and resume it later at the same point.

Automatic merging of backups: If you have two or more damaged copies
of a file, cdrom, etc, and run ddrescue on all of them, one at a time, with
the same output file, you will probably obtain a complete and error-free file.
This is so because the probability of having damaged areas at the same
places on different input files is very low. Using the logfile, only the needed
blocks are read from the second and successive copies.

The logfile is periodically saved to disc. So in case of a crash you can
resume the rescue with little recopying.

Also, the same logfile can be used for multiple commands that copy
different areas of the file, and for multiple recovery attempts over
different subsets.

Ddrescue aligns its I/O buffer to the sector size so that it can be used
to read from raw devices. For efficiency reasons, also aligns it to the
memory page size if page size is a multiple of sector size.
