XSL stylesheets for the DocBook DTD (they are also completely compatible with the DocBook DSSSL DTD and the Simplified DocBook DTD).

DescPackaging: <<
This package version installs the stylesheets in %p/share/xml/xsl/docbook-xsl/, compared to the previous version which installed directly in %p/share/xml/xsl/. This was done to be able to have other stylesheet packages in %p/share/xml/xsl/
