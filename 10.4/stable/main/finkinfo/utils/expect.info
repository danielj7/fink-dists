Description: Tool for automatic interactive applications
DescDetail: <<
Expect is a tool for automating interactive applications such as
telnet, ftp, passwd, fsck, rlogin, tip, etc. Expect really makes this
stuff trivial. Expect is also useful for testing these same
applications. 
<<
DescPort: <<
Expect has to access internal Tcl headers, so it needs to grab the tcl
distribution during build (This should not require an extra download
since the source should still be around from the tcltk dependency).
