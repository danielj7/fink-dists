DescDetail: <<
 Leafnode is a news server suitable for small, limited-bandwidth sites
 with only a few users. Leafnode keeps track of which groups are being
 read, and downloads only articles in those groups. Leafnode has been
 designed to require no maintenance and to be easy to set up.
<<
DescPackaging: During installation a line for the server is added to /etc/inetd.conf
