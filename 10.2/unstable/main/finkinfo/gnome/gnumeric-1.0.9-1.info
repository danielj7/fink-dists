Description: Spreadsheet program for gnome, reads many formats
DescDetail: <<
Spreadsheet program for gnome, reads many spreadsheet formats.

There were reports that for earlier versions of this package, importing 
Excel spreadsheets didn't work (due to lack of shared library support).  
More recent reports suggest that this is now working.  There have been
no reports, positive or negative, about working with other spreadsheet
formats.

If gnumeric crashes when you move the mouse, you must rebuild some of
the dependent libraries.  This is easily done with the "fix-fink"
utility in the "utils" directory of fink.  (The cause is some older
packages which are linked to an outdated version, 50.0.0, of
libSystem.B.dylib .)
<<
DescPort: <<
Leaving out guile support until guile 1.5 is released.
Support for evolution, gb, gda, python may be added later.
Patches:
1) In case the user has a Gnu-Darwin installation with a langinfo.h
   file in /usr/include, we disable the search for a langinfo.h file via 
   config.cache. 
2) Patched ./configure for gcc3 compatibility.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
Given the way that the libxml libraries are packaged in fink, gnumeric uses
the libxml library with libxml2 includes, which seems to be a kind of "partial
upgrade mode" for libxml.
