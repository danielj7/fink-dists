Description: Emulate IO::File interface for in-core strings
DescDetail: <<
IO::String is an IO::File (and IO::Handle) compatible class that reads
or writes data from in-core strings.  It is really just a
simplification of what the author needed from Eryq's IO-stringy modules.  As
such IO::String is a replacement for IO::Scalar.
