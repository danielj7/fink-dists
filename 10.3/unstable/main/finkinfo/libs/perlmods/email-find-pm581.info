Description: Find RFC 822 email addresses in plain text
DescDetail: <<
  Email::Find is a module for finding a *subset* of RFC 822 email
  addresses in arbitrary text (see the section on "CAVEATS"). The
  addresses it finds are not guaranteed to exist or even actually be email
  addresses at all (see the section on "CAVEATS"), but they will be valid
  RFC 822 syntax.

  Email::Find will perform some heuristics to avoid some of the more
  obvious red herrings and false addresses, but there's only so much which
  can be done without a human.
