DescDetail: <<
An ultrafast and memory-efficient tool for aligning sequencing reads 
to long reference sequences. It is particularly good at aligning reads 
of about 50 up to 100s or 1,000s of characters, and particularly good 
at aligning to relatively long (e.g. mammalian) genomes. 

Bowtie 2 indexes the genome with an FM Index to keep its memory footprint
small: for the human genome, its memory footprint is typically 
around 3.2 GB. Bowtie 2 supports gapped, local, and paired-end alignment modes.

Made new install targets to generate man pages (via Ubuntu example)
and to help install things.
