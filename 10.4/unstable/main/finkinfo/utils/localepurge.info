Description: Automatically remove unnecessary locale data
DescDetail: <<
 This is just a simple script to recover diskspace wasted for unneeded
 locale files and localized man pages. It will automatically be
 invoked upon completion of any apt installation run.

 Please note, that this tool is a hack which is *not* integrated with
 Debian's package management system and therefore is not for the faint
 of heart. Responsibility for its usage and possible breakage of your
 system therefore lies in the sysadmin's (your) hands.

 Please definitely do abstain from reporting any bugs blaming
 localepurge if you break your system by using it. If you don't know
 what you are doing and can't handle any resulting breakage on your
 own then please simply don't use this package.

DescPackaging: <<
 Original maintainer: Carsten Klapp <carstenklapp@users.sourceforge.net>
 Wierd patch problem here:
 - patching file etc/apt/apt.conf.d/99-localepurge
 - Hunk #1 succeeded at 4 with fuzz 1.
 Nonstandard Fink use of included DEBIAN control files due to
 dpkg-reconfigure requirement:
 - postinst postrm preinst config templates all bypass their
   respective fields in the Fink info file
<<
DescUsage: <<
 Fink package maintainers should probably not install this package,
 since we need to make sure our packages install everything for users.
