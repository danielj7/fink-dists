DescDetail: <<
RDist  is an open source  program to maintain identical copies of files
over multiple hosts. It preserves the owner, group, mode, and mtime of files
if possible and can update programs that are executing.
<<
DescPort: <<
For security reasons ssh is prefered over rsh for transport, so the
default transport path is set to /usr/bin/ssh on Darwin, not rsh.

Be warned that the code for detecting an NFS mount (i.e. -ochknfs)
probably won't work (it has not been tested).  If someone fixes this in
the future it would be nice to also be able to detect an AFS mount.
