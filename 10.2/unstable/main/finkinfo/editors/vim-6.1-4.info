Description: Improved version of the editor "vi"
DescDetail: <<
VIM adds many of the features that you would expect in an editor: 
Unlimited undo, syntax coloring, split windows, visual selection, 
graphical user interface (read: menus, mouse control, scrollbars, 
text selection), and much much more.
<<
DescPort: <<
Builds gtk GUI. If you don't have X11, use the vim-nox package.
NoSetCPPFLAGS and NoSetLDFLAGS needed to prevent detection of
which vim doesn't like for some reason.
