DescDetail:<<
nXML mode is an addon for GNU Emacs, which makes GNU Emacs into a
powerful XML editor. It's called nXML mode because in Emacs
terminology addons that customize Emacs for editing text of a
particular sort are called modes. Emacs already has a simple mode for
XML; nXML mode is a new mode for XML.

You should realize that Emacs with nXML mode differs from most XML
editors in that XML is edited as text. What you see while you are
editing is similar to what you would see if you were using a non-XML
aware text editor. nXML mode does not attempt to conceal the XML
tags. The big advantage is that you do not lose any functionality in
moving from a text editor to nXML mode. All normal text editing
commands can be used with nXML mode without restriction. nXML mode
does not require that the XML document always be valid or even
well-formed.

nXML mode allows a schema to be associated with the XML document being
edited. The schema is used to provide two key features:

Continuous validation. nXML validates as you type, highlighting any
invalid parts of your document.

Completion. nXML can assist you in entering an element name, attribute
name or data value by using information about what is allowed by the
schema in that context.

nXML mode uses Relax NG as its schema language. Relax NG has two
alternative syntaxes: an XML syntax and a more readable, non-XML
compact syntax. nXML mode supports the compact syntax. There are tools
available to translate from DTDs and other schema languages into Relax
NG compact syntax. Schemas for DocBook, XHTML, XSLT, RDF and RELAX NG
are included in the nXML mode download.

nXML mode can also be used without any schema. Features that work
without any schema include support for inserting end-tags easily.

DescUsage:<<
To use nxml-mode automatically for files with an extension of xml,
xsl, rng or xhtml, add

  (setq auto-mode-alist
        (cons '("\\.\\(xml\\|xsl\\|rng\\|xhtml\\)\\'" . nxml-mode)
              auto-mode-alist))

to your .emacs.

If you edit XML using iso-8859-N encodings other than iso-8859-1 and
you are running Emacs 21.3 or later, then I recommend enabling
unify-8859-on-decoding-mode, by adding

  (unify-8859-on-decoding-mode)

to your .emacs.
