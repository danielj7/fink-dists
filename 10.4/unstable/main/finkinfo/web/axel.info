Description: Light download accelerator for ftp and http
DescDetail: <<
 This program tries to accelerate the downloading process by using multiple
 connections for one file. Starting from version 0.97, the program can use
 different URL's for one download as well. The program tries to be as light
 as possible (25-30k in binary form), so it might be useful as a wget clone
 on byte-critical systems.
<<
DescUsage: <<
 Run the program like this:
  axel ftp://ftp.nl.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.4/linux-2.4.5.tar.bz2
 For a simple single-server-multiple-connection download, or:
 axel ftp://ftp.{nl,be,de}.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.4/linux-2.4.5.tar.bz2
 If you want to use those three servers for the download. The program can do
 an automatic search for FTP mirrors as well (filesearching.com), but that's
 not yet perfect... Just try the -S option. (The line above should at least
 work with the Bash shell. You can type all the mirrors by hand as well, if
 you really want to...)
