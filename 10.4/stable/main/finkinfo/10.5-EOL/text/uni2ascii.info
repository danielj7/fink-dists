Description: Converts text between Unicode and ASCII
DescDetail: <<
uni2ascii and ascii2uni convert between UTF-8 Unicode and more than a
dozen 7-bit ASCII equivalents including: hexadecimal and decimal HTML
numeric character references, \u-escapes, standard hexadecimal, raw
hexadecimal, and RFC2396 URI format. Such ASCII equivalents are
encountered in a variety of circumstances, such as when Unicode text is
included in program source, when entering text into Web programs that can
handle the Unicode character set but are not 8-bit safe, and when debugging.
