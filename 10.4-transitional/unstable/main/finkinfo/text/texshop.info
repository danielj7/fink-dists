Description: TeX previewer for Mac OS X, written in Cocoa
DescDetail: <<
  This is Richard Koch's TeXShop, a GUI frontend for the 
  TeX typesetting system 
<<
DescUsage:<<
 To start this version of TeXShop, double-click on the TeXShop
 icon in the directory /Applications/Fink.
 
 If you have Fink's tetex packages installed, you want to set the two paths in
 Preferences -> Engine to /sw/bin 
 By default, the paths are configured for Gerben Wierda's tex installation.

 The pdfsync.sty from the share/doc/texmacs directory should be copied to 
 ~/Library/texmf/tex/ (Create this directory if it doesn't exist).

 TeXShop is only a GUI frontend for TeX, it does not contain TeX itself. 
 Besides a complete TeX installation, for running TeXShop you proably
 want to install the altpdftex and altpdflatex commands, such as 
 provided by the altpdftex package, one of the ghostscript 
 packages, and imagemagick.

 If you upgraded to this version 2.07 from either 2.05 or 2.06, and
 if you have actually *run* one of these versions before upgrading,
 then you should type the following command in a terminal window:

   defaults write TeXShop ReleaseDocumentClasses 1
<<
DescPackaging: <<
  The TeXShop.app application bundle is installed in
 <finkprefix>/Applications, and there is a symlink in
 /Applications/Fink.

 No universal binary for now, only ppc, as long as there are
 still people using xcode-2.1
