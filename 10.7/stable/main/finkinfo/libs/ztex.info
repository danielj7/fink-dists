Description: Firmware development kit for ZTEX USB board
Homepage: http://www.ztex.de/usb-1/usb-1.0.e.html
License: GPL3
DescDetail: <<
This SDK is especially designed for the ZTEX boards, but also works with other
EZ-USB FX2 based hardware. The SDK consists in a Firmware Development Kit for
EZ-USB FX2 devices and a Java API for the development of the host software.

A unique macro approach gives developers a maximum of flexibility in endpoint
setup just by calling a few macros and without the need of studying the USB
specification. These features distinguish the ZTEX SDK from the products of
competitors.
