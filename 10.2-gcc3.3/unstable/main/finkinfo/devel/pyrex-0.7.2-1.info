Description: Tool to make writing python modules easy
DescDetail: <<
From the webpage: "Pyrex is a language specially designed for writing Python 
extension modules. It's designed to bridge the gap between the nice, 
high-level, easy-to-use world of Python and the messy, low-level world of 
C."  To use the pyrex compiler, type pyrexc at the prompt.
