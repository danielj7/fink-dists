Description: TeX-based WYSIWYG editor
DescDetail: <<
 GNU TeXmacs is a free scientific text editor, which was both inspired
 by TeX and GNU Emacs. The editor allows you to write structured
 documents via a wysiwyg (what-you-see-is-what-you-get) and user
 friendly interface. New styles may be created by the user. The program
 implements high-quality typesetting algorithms and TeX fonts, which
 help you to produce professionally looking documents.

 The high typesetting quality still goes through for automatically
 generated formulas, which makes TeXmacs suitable as an interface for
 computer algebra systems. TeXmacs also supports the Guile/Scheme
 extension language, so that you may customize the interface and write
 your own extensions to the editor.
<<
DescPort:<<
 TeXmacs uses wget for getting online help files; the package depends
 therefore on wget. 
<<
DescUsage:<<
  Provides a unified GUI for macaulay2, maxima, octave, pari-gp, scilab 
if they are installed. 
No configuration necessary, they are auto-detected at program startup.
  Ghostscript is needed for importing images. Since even the TeXmacs 
documentation contains images, ghostscript is strongly recommended. 
There is an unresolved problem with ghostscript version 8, however, that 
lets TeXmacs hang. Ghostscript versions 6 or 7 work fine.
