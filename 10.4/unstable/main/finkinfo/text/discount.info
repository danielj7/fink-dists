DescDetail: <<
 %n is an implementation in C of John Gruber's Markdown
 (http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown) language.  Using Markdown, one
 can write content for the web in a straightforward, human-readable format,
 then quickly compile it to standards-compliant HTML.
<<
DescUsage: <<
 %n installs a command-line utility called markdown.

 The markdown program is a trivial compiler that reads in a markdown file
 and writes out a html document or (if you use the -d flag) an outline
 showing the parse tree.

 comply with Fink's default scripts.
