Description: Tool to encrypt TCP connections
DescDetail: <<
Allows you to encrypt arbitrary TCP connections inside SSL (Secure Sockets Layer). It can
allow you to secure non-SSL aware daemons and protocols (like POP, IMAP, LDAP, etc) by having
it provide the encryption, requiring no changes to the daemon's code.
<<
DescUsage: <<
If you want to use stunnel to secure services you need an .pem file. To have it seperated
from the openssl files it is stored in /sw/var/stunnel. You can easily create it using openssl.
e.g. /sw/bin/openssl req -rand /tmp/egdsocket -new -x509 -days 365 -nodes -out /sw/var/stunnel/stunnel.pem -keyout /sw/var/stunnel/stunnel.pem
then /sw/bin/openssl x509 -subject -dates -fingerprint -noout -in /sw/var/stunnel/stunnel.pem
<<
DescPort: <<
To avoid interactivity in the install process there must be no .pem file created.
This has to be done later if stunnel is meant to be used secure services, could
be needed in some cases stunnel is used as client.
