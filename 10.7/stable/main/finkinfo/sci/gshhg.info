Description: Global dataset of shorelines, rivers, borders
DescDetail: <<
	This package provides five different resolution versions of the GSHHG
	(Global Self-consistent Hierarchical High-resolution Geography)
	data base: course, low, intermediate, high, and full resolution.
	GSHHG combines the World Vector Shoreline and World Data Base II
	products into a single quality-checked hierarchical data base at
	5 resolutions.

	Although these shorelines are distributed as part of the Generic Mapping
	Tools (GMT), they can be used stand-alone or with other applications
	that can read NetCDF files. This version required at least netCDF
	version 4.
<<
DescPort: <<
	This version includes moving the files to %i/share/gmt/gshhg as recently recommended
	at http://gmt.soest.hawaii.edu/projects/gmt/wiki/PackagingGMT/
