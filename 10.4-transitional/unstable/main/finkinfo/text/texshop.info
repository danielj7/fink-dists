Description: TeX previewer for Mac OS X, written in Cocoa
DescDetail: <<
  This is Richard Koch's TeXShop, a GUI frontend for the 
  TeX typesetting system 
<<
DescUsage:<<
 To start this version of TeXShop, double-click on the TeXShop
 icon in the directory /Applications/Fink.
 
 If you have Fink's tetex packages installed, you want to set the two paths in
 Preferences -> Engine to /sw/bin 
 By default, the paths are configured for Gerben Wierda's tex installation.

 The pdfsync.sty from the share/doc/texmacs directory should be copied to 
 ~/Library/texmf/tex/ (Create this directory if it doesn't exist).

 TeXShop is only a GUI frontend for TeX, it does not contain TeX itself. 
 Besides a complete TeX installation, for running TeXShop you proably
 want to install the altpdftex and altpdflatex commands, such as 
 provided by the altpdftex package, one of the ghostscript 
 packages, and imagemagick.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
  The TeXShop.app application bundle is installed in
 <finkprefix>/Applications, and there is a symlink in
 /Applications/Fink.
