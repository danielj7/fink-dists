Package: gpsbabel
Version: 1.4.2
Revision: 1

Description: GPS data transfer and conversion tool

DescDetail: <<
gpsbabel is a command-line utility that translates GPS track, route and
waypoint information between different GPS units and file formats. Most
notably, it can handle GPX files (an emerging "GPS Exchange Format"; see
http://www.topografix.com/gpx.asp for details), Google Maps URLs, and
Google Earth (Keyhole) KML files. Also, gpsbabel can transfer data to
and from many serial and USB GPS units.
<<

DescUsage: <<
Running 'gpsbabel' with no arguments displays a command summary.
'gpsbabel -h | less' will give you the full input/filter/output option
list.

If you are using a serial GPS and a Keyspan USB-to-serial adapter, you
may need to use '/dev/cu.KeySerial1' instead of '/dev/tty.KeySerial1'.
<<

DescPackaging: <<
There is a native OS X GUI, but I have not attempted to build that yet.

There are a few hardcoded instances of '/sw' in the configure script, which I
tried to edit out.

This revision tries not to statically link expat and libusb (by removing the
Darwin-specific sections of ./configure, and letting Fink work its magic).
