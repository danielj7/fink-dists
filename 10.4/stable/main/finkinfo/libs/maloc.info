DescDetail: <<
MALOC (Minimal Abstraction Layer for Object-oriented C) is a small, portable,
abstract C environment library for object-oriented C programming. MALOC is
used as the foundation layer for a number of scientific applications, including
MC, SG, and APBS. MALOC can be used as a small stand-alone abstraction environ-
ment for writing portable C programs which need access to resources which are
typically architecture-dependent, such as INET sockets, timing routines, and 
so on. MALOC provides abstract datatypes, memory management routines, timing
routines, machine epsilon, access to UNIX and INET sockets, MPI, and so on.
