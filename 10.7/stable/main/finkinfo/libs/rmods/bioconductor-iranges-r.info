DescDetail: <<
The package provides efficient low-level and highly reusable S4 classes
for storing ranges of integers, RLE vectors (Run-Length Encoding), and,
more generally, data that can be organized sequentially (formally defined
as Vector objects), as well as views on these Vector objects. Efficient
list-like classes are also provided for storing big collections of instances
of the basic classes. All classes in the package use consistent naming
and share the same rich and consistent "Vector API" as much as possible.
