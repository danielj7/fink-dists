Description: Convert xfig objs with -graphicx (-epsfig is deprecated)
DescPort: <<
 We don't need xpm since it is already in XFree86 4.1.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
 Compiled with LaTeX 2e options chosen rather than LaTeX
 2.09. XFIGLIBDIR was set to %p/share/xfig (as in xfig).  
 Now available in two variants, the -epsfig variant to agree with
 the historically available 'transfig' fink package, and the
 -graphicx variant which removes the now-deprecated compile-time epsfig
 option.

 This package does not compile against libpng15, and since it
 is no longer being developed/maintained, it might never do so.
 
 AKH: When building with clang 4+, (Xcode 4.4+), there are errors of the form:
 
 genibmgl.c:575:29: error: non-void function 'set_width' should return a value [-Wreturn-type]
    if (w == current_width) return;
    
 Unfortunately, these errors don't cause the build to quit, but instead users wind up
 with a misbuilt package which is missing most of the executables, including fig2dev.  
 By turning off some of the clang strictness via CPPFLAGS, the package appears to build
 completely.
<<
DescUsage: <<
 This package is automatically called by xfig, although it is
 also possible to invoke "fig2dev" directly from the command line.
