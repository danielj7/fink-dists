Description: Distributed revision control(archive) system
DescDetail: <<
Arch is a really nifty revision control system. It's "whole-tree changeset
based" which means, roughly, that it can handle (with atomic commits) file and
directory adds, deletes, and renames cleanly, and that it does branching simply
and easily. Arch is also "distributed" which means, for example that you can
make arch branches of your own from remote projects, even if you don't have
write access to the revision control archives for those projects.
