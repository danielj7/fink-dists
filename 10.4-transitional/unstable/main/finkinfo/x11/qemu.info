Description: Fast CPU Emulator
DescDetail: <<
QEMU is a FAST! processor emulator using dynamic translation to achieve good 
emulation speed.
QEMU has two operating modes: 
- Full system emulation. In this mode, QEMU emulates
  a full system (for example a PC), including a processor and various 
  peripherials. It can be used to launch different Operating Systems without
  rebooting the PC or to debug system code.  
- User mode emulation (Linux host only). In this mode, QEMU can launch Linux 
  processes compiled for one CPU on another CPU.  It can be used to launch 
  the Wine Windows API emulator or to ease cross-compilation and 
  cross-debugging.
As QEMU requires no host kernel patches to run, it is very safe and easy to 
use.
