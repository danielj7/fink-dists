Package: file
Version: 4.03
Revision: 1
Description: Determine file type (magic)
License: Restrictive/Distributable
DescDetail: <<
 Identifies a file's type based on the contents then provides a
 description or a mime type.

 'File' tests each argument in an attempt to classify it. There are
 three sets of tests, performed in this order: filesystem tests,
 magic number tests, and language tests. The first test that
 succeeds causes the file type to be printed.

 Released May 24, 2003

 The file command was altered in 2000 to output mime type strings and
 uses an alternative magic file and internal logic. (Apple's file
 command is old: version 3.22 with Mac OS X 10.2-10.2.5 / Darwin 6.0-6.5). 
<<
DescUsage: <<
 The '-i' option causes the file command to output mime type strings
 rather than the more traditional human readable ones. Thus it may say
 "text/plain; charset=us-ascii" rather than "ascii text".

DescPort: <<
 New in version 4:
 - UpdateConfigGuess no longer required.
 - Shared and static libraries added.
 - Shared library not built to enable prebinding. The dylib can be
   added to the package at a later time once other new software is
   developed which would depend on it. (The main executable 'file'
   does not even link against it yet!(?))
<<
DescPackaging: <<
 The older 3.14 branch will be kept in Fink for a while, provided the
 source remains available. This new build has significant changes such
 as latest autoconf and optional shlibs.
