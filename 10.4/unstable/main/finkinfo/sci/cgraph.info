Description: Postscript plotting library in C
DescDetail: <<
This is a C source code library that contains a set of C functions that
generate PostScript for publication quality scientific plots. It is
possible to launch Preview.app automatically on generated PS/EPS files. The
Cgraph Library source code, examples, and documentation are in the public
domain.  Why do we want something like this, when Mac and Windows apps can
finally produce nice plots? Those GUI apps are OK for small number of
plots, but if you ever need to plot tens or hundreds of similarly formatted
graphs fast, GUIs become very tedius. Also, if you need to generate plots
automatically, e.g., those stock price charts updated every tens of minutes
available from some Web sites, a program that incorporates this library may
be used to generate EPS files from current data, which can be piped into
Ghostscript (or DPS) to update GIF images without manual intervention.
