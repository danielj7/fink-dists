Description: Printed Circuit Board design program

DescDetail: <<
PCB allows you to design PCBs. You can use gnetlist (part of geda-gnetlist) to
create a netlist to ensure that your PCB matches a schematic diagram created
with gschem.

All coordinate units are 1/1000 inch (mils).
<<

DescPort: <<
Things just got a lot easier now that PCB uses auto* tools instead of imake.
<<

DescPackaging: <<
Stroke support is included, but largely untested on OS X. You will probably
need a 3-button mouse for this.
