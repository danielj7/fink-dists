DescUsage: <<
	Please see the included help for how to use fish. Typing 'help'
	at the command prompt will launch a browser window with the help file.
	By default, the help command will try to launch an X11 browser like
	firefox if present. If you want it to use your default Mac OS X browser,
	set the environment variable BROWSER to 'open'. From bash use
	export BROWSER=open
	or from within fish use
	set BROWSER 'open'
	or you could use a text-based browser like lynx.
	
	Also see http://lwn.net/Articles/136232/ for an introduction to fish.
	
	If you wish to use fish as your login shell, add %p/bin/fish to /etc/shells.
	%p/bin is automatically added to the end of the PATH.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
	Fish requires a 'seq' command. OS X doesn't have one. coreutils-default
	does. If coreutils-default is installed, fish will use it but if not it
	will install its own 'seq' command. This is bad and I don't know how to
	get around it other than Depending on coreutils-default which is
	unacceptable. Therefore my only choice is to Conflict with
	coreutils-default until I can come up with a better idea.
