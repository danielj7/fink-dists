Description: Fast and lightweight GTK+ IDE
DescDetail: <<
Geany is a small and lightweight integrated development environment. It was
developed to provide a small and fast IDE, which has only a few dependencies
on other packages. Another goal was to be as independent as possible from a
special Desktop Environment like KDE or GNOME.
