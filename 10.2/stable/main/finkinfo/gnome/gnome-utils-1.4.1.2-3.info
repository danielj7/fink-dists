Description: GNOME utility programs
DescDetail: <<
GNOME (GNU Network Object Model Environment) is a user-friendly set of
applications and desktop tools to be used in conjunction with a window
manager for the X Window System.  GNOME is similar in purpose and scope
to CDE and KDE, but GNOME is based completely on free software.

This package will install some GNOME utilities, such as the
calculator, search tool, and system information overview tool.

DescPort: <<

.
gdialog is disabled because it doesn't compile with Apple's curses
implementation.
