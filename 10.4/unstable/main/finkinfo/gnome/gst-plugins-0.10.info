GStreamer is a streaming-media framework, based on graphs of 
filters which operate on media data. Applications using this 
library can do anything from real-time sound processing to 
playing videos. Its plugin-based architecture means that new 
data types or processing capabilities can be added simply by 
installing new plugins.

This package is a wrapper to install all known GStreamer
plugins.
