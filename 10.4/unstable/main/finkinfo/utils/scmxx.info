Description:	Exchange data with Siemens mobile phones
DescDetail: <<
SCMxx is a console program that allows you to exchange certain types
of data with mobile phones made by Siemens. Some of the data types
that can be exchanged are logos, ring tones, vCalendars, phonebook
entries, and SMS messages. It works with the S25, S35i, M35i and C35i,
SL45, S45 and ME45 and probably others.

You need a serial connection (either cable or infrared) to your mobile
phone in order to use SCMxx.

It basically uses the AT command set published by Siemens (with some
other, additional resources).
