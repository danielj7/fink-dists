 CCP4 now provides a self-contained installer and update system, and no longer 
 provides source-code updates or patches between releases, making maintenance of
 a fink-installed version of CCP4 untenable. CCP4 now distributes 64-bit 
 binaries as of version 6.5, so users no longer need to install a the fink 
 package to obtain a 64-bit version of CCP4. CCP4 has also released a set of 
 libraries under the LGPL. These are provided in the following fink packages: 
 libccp4, clipper, mmdb, ssm. Fink packages for the CCP4-associated programs 
 refmac, xia2 and coot are also provided, as is an mpi version of the molecular
 replacement program phaser.
