DescDetail:<<
	Solfege is an ear training program for X11 written in python, using the
	GTK+ and GNOME libraries. 

	Eartraining is a big subject with many connections to music theory and
	performance of music, so it is hard even trying to make "a complete
	computer-based ear training course". But someone will hopfully find this
	software useful.
	
	A lot of efforts has gone into the non-english translation of
	docs and lessons: please set up the language environment
	properly, with e.g:
	$ export LANGUAGE="fr_FR"	
<<
DescPackaging:<<

* I spent some time scrutinizing all dependencies, and installing from
  source or binaries on a fresh fink. For instance, Debian makes solfege
  depend on lilypond, and thus ghostscript, which is not really necessary.

* $ fink validate solfege.info 
  $ fink -m -k --build-as-nobody rebuild solfege
  Package looks good!

* depends on python26, but could work with 25 or 24: should maybe make 2 packages (splitoff??)

* It took me some time to get rid of absolute paths in .pyc files.

<<
DescUsage:<<
* Needs X11: check if /Applications/Utilities/X11.app is there, 
  or install it from the original DVD.

* then, in a terminal, type:
    $ solfege

* If you want to translate .midi files into .wav, install
     $ fink install timidity-nox
  Is not done by default because it loads 25Mb of sound patterns...

* To benefit from the huge translation effort, make sure your language
  environment is set, e.g. with:
	$ export LANGUAGE="fr_FR"	

* Have fun, and see you in 10 years, when you pass all tests easily while
watching TV...
