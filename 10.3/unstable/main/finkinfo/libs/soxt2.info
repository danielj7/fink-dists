Description: X11/Xt/Xm GUI lib for OpenInventor/Coin3D
DescDetail: <<
Use X11/Xt for an OpenInventor GUI.  This provides the X11
interface for the Coin/Inventor 3D scene graph library originally
designed by SGI.  Uses both Xt and Xm (Motif/Lesstif).

Note: This version of soxt requires that your programs link with the
GLUT framework like this

   -framework GLUT

This requirement will probably go away after soxt 1.2.1
<<
DescPort: <<
Do not use SoXt 1.2.0 as there was a bug in the doxygen handling.

There are lots of overlapping man pages between soqt and soxt, so they
all get renamed in soxt.  iv is for InVentor.  On Irix, OpenInventor
man pages are in the 3iv catagory.
