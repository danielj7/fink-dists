DescDetail: <<

WhySynth is a versatile softsynth which operates as a plugin for the
DSSI Soft Synth Interface.  A brief list of features:

- 4 oscillators, 2 filters, 3 LFOs, and 5 envelope generators per
    voice.

- 10 oscillator modes: minBLEP, wavecycle, asynchronous granular,
    three FM modes, waveshaper, noise, PADsynth, and phase
    distortion.

- 6 filter modes.

- flexible modulation and mixdown options, plus effects.

DSSI is a plugin API for software instruments (soft synths) with
user interfaces, permitting them to be hosted in-process by audio
applications.  More information on DSSI can be found at:

  http://dssi.sourceforge.net/

WhySynth is something of a mongrel, combining bits from Xsynth-DSSI,
hexter, Csound, Mats Olsson's MSS, and various other programs, with
inspiration from a number of my favorite long-hair-days synths
(Matrix 6, ESQ-1, K4), and wavecycle data resynthesized from Claude
Kaber's Virtual K4 samples and //christian's exegesis of the Ensoniq
SQ-80 wavetable ROMs. See the enclosed file AUTHORS for more
details.

this license, I (Sean) would appreciate any or all of the following
should you find WhySynth useful:

    - an email stating where you're from and how you're using
        WhySynth, sent to <musound /at/ jps /dot/ net>, or better
        yet, a postcard sent to:
            Sean Bolton
            1223 SE Ash St
            Portland Oregon 97214 USA

    - copies of or links to music you've created with WhySynth.

    - any patches you create for WhySynth. Yes! Please!

    - suggestions for improving WhySynth.

The patches distributed with WhySynth, including the default
'factory' patches and those found in the 'extra' directory, have
been placed in the public domain by their respective authors.  See
the enclosed file extra/COPYING-patches for details.

The GUI is stiflingly dull.  Anyone want to help make it look cool?
