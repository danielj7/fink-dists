Description: DEPRECATED -- use Wireshark instead
DescDetail: <<
It is strongly recommended that you use the 'wireshark'
package, which is the successor of ethereal, instead of this
one. Ethereal does not receive any security updates anymore.
Various serious security problems with ethereal have been
fixed in 'wireshark'.
