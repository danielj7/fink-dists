Description: C++/Fortran-90 double-double and quad-double
DescDetail: <<
 This package supports both a double-double datatype (approx. 32 decimal
 digits) and a quad-double datatype (approx. 64 decimal digits). The
 computational library is written in C++. Both C++ and Fortran-90 high-level
 language interfaces are provided to permit one to use convert an existing C++
 or Fortran-90 program to use the library with only minor changes to the source
 code. In most cases only a few type statements and (for Fortran-90 programs)
 read/write statements need to be changed. PSLQ and numerical quadrature
 programs are included.
