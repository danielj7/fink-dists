Description: GPL molecular dynamics package
DescDetail: <<
GROMACS is a versatile package to perform molecular dynamics, i.e. 
simulate the Newtonian equations of motion for systems with 
hundreds to millions of particles.
It is primarily designed for biochemical molecules like proteins 
and lipids that have a lot of complicated bonded interactions, but 
since GROMACS is extremely fast at calculating the nonbonded 
interactions (that usually dominate simulations) many groups are 
also using it for research on non-biological systems, e.g. 
polymers.
The directories tutor, top, template and html are in
/sw/share/gromacs  Copy the tutor directory to your home
directory to use the tutorial.
