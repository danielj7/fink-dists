Description: Command-line DVD ripper
DescDetail: <<
dvdbackup is a tool for ripping DVD's from the command line.
dvdbackup will extract all (or optionally only selected) titles as
found on the dvd. It will structure the extracted files in a format
suitable for burning at a later time with mkisofs and dvdrecord.  It
has the advantage of being very easy to use, small, and fast.
