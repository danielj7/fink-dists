Description: FUSE NTFS filesystem
DescDetail: <<
	The NTFS-3G driver is an open source, freely available NTFS driver
	for Linux with read and write support. It provides safe and fast
	handling of the Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows 2000 and
	Windows Vista file systems. Most POSIX file system operations are
	supported, with the exception of full file ownership and access
	right support.
<<
DescUsage: <<
	To connect to an NTFS volume:
	
	first unmount the NTFS disk if currently mounted read-only
	(you can use Disk Utility to do this and also to get the partition)
	
	mkdir mountpoint
	ntfs-3g /dev/diskpartition mountpoint -ovolname="Volume Name"
	
	where mountpoint is directory to mount the disk,
	diskpartition is the NTFS disk's partition in /dev
	and Volume Name is the disk's volume name.
	
	To disconnect:
	umount mountpoint
	or eject from the Finder.
	
	See ntfs-3g man page for more options.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
	Changed mount.ntfs-3g symlink to mount_ntfs-3g to match standard on darwin.
	Made %p/bin/ntfs-3g setuid so non-root users can mount volumes. It drops
	root privileges after mounting, so should be safe.
	Disabled shared library since nothing else uses it and the lib version
	keeps changing.
