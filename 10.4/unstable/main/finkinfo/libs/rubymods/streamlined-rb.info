# Additional Data:
DescDetail: <<
	Streamlined is a framework for rapidly developing CRUD applications
	using Ruby and Rails. With Streamlined, we are trying to accomplish:

	* provide the same declarative ease-of-use to the view layer that
	  ActiveRecord provides for the data layer
	* automatically manage relationships in the view layer so that users
	  don't have to keep writing the same relationship management code
	* replace the default scaffolding of Rails with more robust, useful
	  and meaningful management screens
	* provide a meta-framework which allows you to assimilate different
	  Rails plugins and generators

If you already have a database schema, our intent is to allow you to
create a usable, robust, and above all, customizable administrative
interface for it in five minutes or less.
