Description: Set of subroutines for perl
DescDetail: <<
  This package contains a selection of subroutines that people have
  expressed would be nice to have in the perl core, but the usage would not
  really be high enough to warrant the use of a keyword, and the size so
  small such that being individual extensions would be wasteful.
<<
###
DescPort: <<
  Disabled 'make test' based on README:

  There is a bug in perl5.6.0 with UV's that are >= 1<<31. This will
  show up as tests 8 and 9 of dualvar.t failing
