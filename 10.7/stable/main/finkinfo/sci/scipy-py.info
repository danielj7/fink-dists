Description: Scientific tools for Python
DescDetail: <<
SciPy (pronounced "Sigh Pie") is open-source software for mathematics,
science, and engineering. It is also the name of a very popular
conference on scientific programming with Python. The SciPy library
depends on NumPy, which provides convenient and fast N-dimensional
array manipulation. The SciPy library is built to work with NumPy
arrays, and provides many user-friendly and efficient numerical
routines such as routines for numerical integration and
optimization. Together, they run on all popular operating systems, are
quick to install, and are free of charge. NumPy and SciPy are easy to
use, but powerful enough to be depended upon by some of the world's
leading scientists and engineers. If you need to manipulate numbers on
a computer and display or publish the results, give SciPy a try!

DescPackaging: <<
The LDFLAGS environment variable is unset, because it overwrites the
link options, including the ones which provide the libpython2.5
library.

The patch script allow to compile scipy-py with the suitesparse
packagee installed. See:
