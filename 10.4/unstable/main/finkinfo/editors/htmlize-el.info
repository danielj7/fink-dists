Descdetail: <<
From the Commentary section of htmlize.el:

This package converts the buffer text and the associated decorations
to HTML.  htmlize supports three types of HTML output, selected by
setting `htmlize-output-type': `css', `inline-css', and `font'.  In
`css' mode, htmlize uses cascading style sheets to specify colors; it
generates classes that correspond to Emacs faces and uses <span
class=FACE>...</span> to color parts of text.  In this mode, the
produced HTML is valid under the 4.01 strict DTD, as confirmed by the
W3C validator.  `inline-css' is like `css', except the CSS is put
directly in the STYLE attribute of the SPAN element, making it
possible to paste the generated HTML to other documents.  In `font'
mode, htmlize uses <font color="...">...</font> to colorize HTML,
which is not standard-compliant, but works better in older browsers.
`css' mode is the default.

You can also use htmlize from your Emacs Lisp code.  When called
non-interactively, `htmlize-buffer' and `htmlize-region' will
return the resulting HTML buffer, but will not change current
buffer or move the point.

DescUsage: <<
From the Commentary section of htmlize.el:

To use this, just switch to the buffer you want HTML-ized and type
`M-x htmlize-buffer'.  You will be switched to a new buffer that
contains the resulting HTML code.  You can edit and inspect this
buffer, or you can just save it with C-x C-w.  `M-x htmlize-file' will
find a file, fontify it, and save the HTML version in FILE.html,
without any additional intervention.  `M-x htmlize-many-files' allows
you to htmlize any number of files in the same manner.  `M-x
htmlize-many-files-dired' does the same for files marked in a dired
buffer.
