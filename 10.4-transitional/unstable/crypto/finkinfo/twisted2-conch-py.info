Version: 0.6.0
Revision: 1
Description: SSH/SFTP protocol implementation
DescDetail: <<
Conch is an SSHv2 implementation written in Python. SSH is
a protocol designed to allow remote access to shells and
commands, but it is generic enough to allow everything from
TCP forwarding to generic filesystem access. Since conch is
written in Python, it interfaces well with other Python
projects, such as Imagination. Conch also includes a
implementations of the telnet and vt102 protocols, as well as
support for rudamentary line editing behaviors. A new
implementation of Twisted's Manhole application is also included,
featuring server-side input history and interactive syntax
coloring.
