Description: Cyrus Simple Authentication and Security Layer Library
DescDetail: <<
 SASL is the Simple Authentication and Security Layer, a method for adding 
authentication support to connection-based protocols. To use SASL, a
protocol includes a command for identifying and authenticating a user to a
server and for optionally negotiating protection of subsequent protocol
interactions. If its use is negotiated, a security layer is inserted
between the protocol and the connection.
<<
DescPort: <<
 Patch to fix a build problem for users with a /usr/local/include on there
system and to stop the creation and installing of a framework.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
Due to a conflict with the essential fink package "dpkg", the include files 
for cyrus-sasl have been moved to a directory "include/cyrus-sasl/".  This
may affect other packages which depend on this one. Moved the manual pages
to there own splitoff so cyrus-sasl and cyrus-sasl2 can co-exist happliy.
