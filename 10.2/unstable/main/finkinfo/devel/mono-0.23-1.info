DescDetail: <<
The Mono runtime implements a JIT engine for the CIL virtual machine
(as well as a byte code interpreter, this is to quickly port it to
new systems), the class loader, the garbage collector, threading
system and metadata access libraries.

On Darwin currently only the interpreter (mint) is supported; the
mono JIT only works on x86 platforms.
