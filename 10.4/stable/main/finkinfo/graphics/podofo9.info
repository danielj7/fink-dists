  DocFiles: AUTHORS COPYING ChangeLog README.html
  Description: Library to work with the PDF file format
  DescDetail: <<
The PoDoFo library is a free, portable C++ library
which includes classes to parse PDF files and modify
their contents into memory.
The changes can be written back to disk easily.
The parser can also be used to extract information
from a PDF file (for example the parser could be used
in a PDF viewer). Besides parsing PoDoFo includes also
very simple classes to create your own PDF files.
All classes are documented so it is easy to start
writing your own application using PoDoFo.

The PoDoFo tools are simple tools built around the PoDoFo library.
These tools are first of all examples on how to use the PoDoFo
library in your own projects. But secondly they offer also
features for working with PDF files.
