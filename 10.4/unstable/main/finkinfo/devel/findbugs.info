DescDetail: <<
FindBugs is a program to find bugs in Java programs.  It looks for
instances of "bug patterns" --- code instances that are likely to be
errors.

Changes since version 1.1.2:

  * Fixed broken Ant task
  * Added running ant task to smoketest
  * Added validating xml and html output to smoketest
  * Fixed some (but not all) issues with html output validation
  * Added check for x.equals(x) and x.compareTo(x)

Changes since version 1.1.1:

  * Added check for infinite iterative loops
  * Added check for use of incompatible types in a collection (e.g.,
    checking to see if a Set<String> contains a StringBuffer).
  * Added check for invocations of equals or hashCode on a URL, which,
    surprising many people, requires DNS resolution.
  * Added check for classes that define compareTo but not equals; such
    classes can exhibit some anomalous behavior (e.g., they are
    treated differently by PriorityQueues in Java 5 and Java 6).
  * Added a check for useless self operations (e.g., x < x or x ^ x).
  * Fixed a datarace that could cause the GUI to fail on startup
  * Partial internationalization of the new GUI
  * Fix bug in "Redo analysis" option of new GUI
  * Tuning to reduce false positives
  * Fixed a bug in null pointer analysis that was generating false
    positive null pointer warnings on exception paths. Fixing this bug
    eliminates about 1/4 of the warnings on null pointer exceptions on
    exception paths.
  * Fixed a bug in the processing of phi nodes for fields in the null
    pointer analysis
  * Applied contributed patch that provides more quick fixes in Eclipse plugin.
  * Fixed progress bar in Eclipse plugin
  * A number of other bug fixes.

launch the program contain some code subject to the Apache Software

This is why I've set the License field to OSI-Approved
