Description: Interface to Maxima using wxWidgets
DescDetail: <<
wxMaxima is a cross platform GUI for the computer algebra system maxima based 
on wxWidgets.  wxMaxima features include:
*	2D formatted math display: wxMaxima implements its own math display 
	engine to nicely display maxima output.
*	Menu system: most maxima commands are available through menus. Most 
	used functions are also available through a button panel at below the 
	input line.
*	Dialogs: commands which require more that one argument can be entered
	through dialogs so that there is no need to remember the exact syntax.
*	Command line history: the input line has command history and command 
	completion based on previous input.
*	Create documents: text can be mixed with math calculations to create 
	documents. See the
	howto (http://wxmaxima.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Howto)
	for tips on how to use these features. Documents can be saved and edited
	again later.

DescUsage: <<
You can either use the  app bundle in %p/Applications, which is
symlinked in /Applications/Fink, or the "wxmaxima" command-line
script.
The wxplot2d command doesn't work in maxima-5.20.0, unless you run

	set_plot_option([gnuplot_preamble,""]);

first.  This is fixed in 5.21.0 and later.

## GTK stub
##The "%p/bin/wxmaxima" convenience script will throw an initial error
##in the GTK version, but using "Restart" from the system dialog box
##allows it to run without further ado.  The app in %p/Applications does
##not throw this error.
##The aforementioned script doesn't start X11 on Tiger:  you'll have
##to do that yourself.

DescPackaging:<<
Since Fink's maxima is in the crypto tree, and this Depends on it, it 
must go in the crypto tree too.
I haven't been able to get the -gtk version to work properly; I've
left stub stuff for it in place in case it gets figured out.
<<
DescPort:<<
Patch file installs a wrapper script in the .app bundle to insure 
that Fink's environment is used.
Upstream now wants the inner program name (in the app bundle) to be 
"wxmaxima" rather than "wxMaxima".
We remove the %p/bin/wxmaxima applications that upstream buids and
replace them by a script using "open -a %p/Applications/wxMaxima.app."
