Description: Icarus Verilog

DescDetail: <<
Icarus Verilog is a Verilog compiler that generates a variety of
engineering formats, including simulation. It strives to be true
to the IEEE-1364 standard.

A testbench is available at http://sourceforge.net/projects/ivtest
<<

DescPort: <<
Instructions from macos.txt were followed, adapting them for the
Fink way of doing things.
<<

DescPackaging: <<
SetCXXFLAGS is used because CPPFLAGS does not appear to be honored (this
problem manifests itself as an inability to find readline/readline.h).
