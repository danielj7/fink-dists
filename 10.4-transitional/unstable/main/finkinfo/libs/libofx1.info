DescDetail: <<
This is the LibOFX library.  It is a API designed to allow applications to 
very easily support
OFX command responses, usually provided by financial institutions.  
See http://www.ofx.net/ofx/default.asp for details and specification. This 
project was first 
started as my end of degree project, with the objective to add OFX support to 
GnuCash 
http://www.gnucash.org/ If you can read French, the original project 
presentation is included 
in the doc directory.  I finally decided to make it into a generic library, 
so all OpenSource 
financial software can benefit.
