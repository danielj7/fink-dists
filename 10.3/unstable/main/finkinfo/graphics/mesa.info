DescDetail: <<
Mesa is a 3-D graphics library with an API which
is very similar to that of OpenGL.* To the extent 
that Mesa utilizes the OpenGL command syntax or 
state machine, it is being used with authorization 
from Silicon Graphics, Inc.(SGI). However, the 
author does not possess an OpenGL license from 
SGI, and makes no claim that Mesa is in any way 
a compatible replacement for OpenGL or associated 
with SGI. Those who want a licensed implementation 
of OpenGL should contact a licensed vendor. 
<<
DescUsage: <<
The libraries and headers are installed in 
%p/lib/mesa and %p/include/mesa, respectively. This 
is toavoid conflict with other OpenGL dependent 
packages in Fink like GLUT/ freeglut, etc. To use the
libraries and headers installed, you need to 
explicitly set the Include (-I) and Linker (-L)
flags before compiling against Mesa3d. The order
in which the flags are passed to the linker
is also important, so that Mesa libraries is the 
one that is seen first by the linker (before the
system OpenGL). 

Care needs to be taken to avoid system OpenGL,
if you want to use Mesa3d, while compiling, like
making sure that its first in the linker's search
path. Otherwise, you get runtime errors.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
A link is created from %p/include/mesa and 
%p/lib/mesa to %p/share/mesa/include and 
%p/share/mesa/lib, respectively. This is done to 
facilitate compiling certain programmes which look 
for a common GL directory containing an include 
directory (with gl.h, etc.) and lib directory 
(with libGL.*, etc.).
