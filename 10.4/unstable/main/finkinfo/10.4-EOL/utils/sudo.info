Description: Grant certain users/groups superuser rights
DescDetail: <<
Sudo (superuser do) allows a system administrator to give certain
 users (or groups of users)the ability to run some (or all) 
commands as root while logging all commands and arguments.
Sudo operates on a per-command basis, it is not a replacement 
for the shell. 
It's features include:

* The ability to restrict what commands a user 
	may run on a per-host basis.

* Sudo does copious logging of each command, providing a 
clear audit trail of who did what. When used in tandem 
with syslogd, the system log daemon, sudo can log all 
commands to a central host (as well as on the local host). 
At CU, all admins use sudo in lieu of a root shell 
to take advantage of this logging.

* Sudo uses timestamp files to implement a "ticketing" system. 
When a user invokes sudo and enters their password, they are 
granted a ticket for 5 minutes (this timeout is configurable 
at compile-time). Each subsequent sudo command 
updates the ticket for another 5 minutes. 
This avoids the problem of leaving a root shell where others 
can physically get to your keyboard. There is also 
an easy way for a user to remove their ticket file, 
useful for placing in a .logout file.

* Sudo's configuration file, the sudoers file, is setup in 
such a way that the same sudoers file may be used on many 
machines. This allows for central administration 
while keeping the flexibility to define a user's 
privileges on a per-host basis. 
Please see the samples sudoers file in your doc 
directory for a real-world example.
