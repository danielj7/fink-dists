Description: XML parsing library, version 2
DescDetail: <<
  This set of packages does *not* contain the python bindings. Those
  are in libxml2-pyXX for various pythonX.X versions.
<<
DescPort: <<
  The Makefile is too stupid to link the executables against the right
  copy of the library, so we help by setting LDFLAGS. Otherwise we get
  contamination if an older version of libxml2 is already installed
  while building.

  Libtool gets patched to fix bundle (loadable module, .so file) building.

  Make sure we don't link to fink's dlcompat lib.

  ./configure checks for xmllint and xsltproc, which would cause
  circular dependencies (on libxml2-bin (build here) and libxslt-bin
  (depends on libxml2)). Fortunately, these executables are only used
  to build docs that we do not build.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
Uses pkgconfig, but there are no pkgconfig-related dependencies.

libxml2 uses XML/SGML super catalog to know location of DTDs installed on
local system. They are managed by update-xml-catalog and update-sgml-catalog
script. Each package that provides DTDs should also provide configuration
file(s) for these script and call them within Pre/PostInstScript.

When update-xml-catalog is called, it reads every configuration file belongs
to %p/etc/xml/catalog.d/. Each line of them contain 3 fields, TYPE, ORIG and
REPLACE, correspond to arguments of `xmlcatalog --add'. See xmlcatalog(1) for
detail.

Also, update-sgml-catalog reads every configuration file belongs to %p/etc/
sgml/catalog.d/ when it is called. Each line of them contain only 1 field,
reference to other SGML catalog file.
