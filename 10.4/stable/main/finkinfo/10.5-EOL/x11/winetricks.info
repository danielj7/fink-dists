DescDetail: <<
Winetricks is a quick and dirty script to download and install
various redistributable runtime libraries sometimes needed to
run programs in Wine.

Note: Although using winetricks may be very useful for getting
some programs working in Wine, doing so may limit your ability
to get support though WineHQ.  In particular, reporting bugs
may not be possible.
