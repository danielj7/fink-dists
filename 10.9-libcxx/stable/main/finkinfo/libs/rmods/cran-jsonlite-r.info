DescDetail: <<
A fast JSON parser and generator optimized for statistical data and the web.
Started out as a fork of RJSONIO, but has been completely rewritten in
recent versions. The package offers flexible, robust, high performance
tools for working with JSON in R and is particularly powerful for building
pipelines and interacting with web APIs. The implementation is based on the
mapping described in the vignette of the package (Ooms, 2014). In addition
to drop-in replacements for toJSON and fromJSON, jsonlite contains functions
to stream, validate, and prettify JSON data. The unit tests included with
the package verify that all edge cases are encoded and decoded consistently
for use with dynamic data in systems and applications.
