Description: Denial-of-service counter measure tool
DescDetail: <<
Hashcash is a denial-of-service counter measure system.  Its main use
is to help hashcash users avoid losing email due to content based and
blacklist based anti-spam systems.

Hashcash is payment in burnt CPU cycles by calculating n-bit partial
hash collisions on chosen texts. A hashcash token constitutes a
proof-of-work which takes a parameterizable amount of work to compute
for the sender.

The hashcash tool allows you to create hashcash tokens to attach to
emails you send, and to verify hashcash tokens attached to emails you
receive.
