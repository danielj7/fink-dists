 Samba settings are set in the configuration file 'smb.conf'. installed in

 To enable this version of Samba instead of the version installed with 10.2
do the following;

 1. Backup the default 10.2 Samba startupitem found in /System/Library
/StartupItems, incase ever needed.

 2. Replace the default 10.2 Samba startupitem with the startupitem found
in yourfinkdirectory/share/samba/StartupItems. Please note if you have
fink installed outside of the default 'sw' you will have to edit the
startupitem to point it towards your fink install.
 
 3.Finally highlight "Windows File Sharing" in the System Preferences,
"Sharing" under the "Services" tab and press "Start".

 To enable Swat do the following;

1. Add the following line to "/etc/inetd.conf";
"swat  stream  tcp  nowait  root  /sw/sbin/swat  swat" and

2. Add the following line to "/etc/services"; "swat  901/tcp", reboot then

3. Open your favourite web browser and point it at http://localhost:901/
