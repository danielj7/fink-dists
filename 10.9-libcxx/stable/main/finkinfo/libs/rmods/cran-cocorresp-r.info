DescDetail: <<
Fits predictive and symmetric co-correspondence analysis (CoCA) model
to relate one data matrix to another data matrix. More specifically,
CoCA maximises the weighted covariance between the weighted averaged
species scores of one community and the weighted averaged species
scores of another community. CoCA attempts to find patterns that are
common to both communitities.
