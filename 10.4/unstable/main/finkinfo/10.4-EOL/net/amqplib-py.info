Description: AMQP messaging client

DescDetail: <<
Implements a simple non-threaded Python client library for AMQP 0-8,
tested with RabbitMQ.

The initial need was for something that could be used in an embedded
Python environment, in which case reliance on threading would probably
cause trouble. A quick connection time was desirable too. QPID takes a
while to parse the AMQP spec file, but this module relies on a
skeleton generated statically from the 0-8 spec file and fleshed it
out by hand.

Also features SSL support (tested against RabbitMQ behind a Stunnel)

If you need something that can better handle asynchronous messaging,
txAMQP for Twisted Python may be what you're looking for.
