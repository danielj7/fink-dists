TAP-plugins is short for Tom's Audio Processing plugins. It is a bunch
of LADSPA plugins for digital audio processing, intended for use in a
professional DAW environment such as Ardour. These plugins should
compile and run on any recent (that is, not seriously outdated)
GNU/Linux system. They don't require any special libraries besides the
standard GNU C and math libraries, which are expected to be provided
on the machine used for compiling.

Check the LADSPA homepage for links to other great plugins available
on the Linux platform. Also feel free to check out LinuxLinks.com and
get a feel of the amazing amount of excellent software available on
Linux (you will find TAP-plugins in the section
Software/Multimedia/Tools). Dave Phillips also has a very complete
link collection of Linux MIDI & Sound Applications.

The plugins have been developed with Ardour as a primary host in mind,
but they should be usable within any LADSPA-capable host. The main
issue here is that LADSPA plugins don't generate their own GUIs, but
the GUIs are generated by the host. Therefore the arrangement and
appearance of the controls may vary using another host. In particular,
Ardour displays drop-down lists instead of pure integer inputs in
LADSPA plugin GUIs, if and when appropriate RDF metadata of the
plugins is available. TAP-plugins makes use of this feature, see the
screenshots of TAP Dynamics and TAP Reverberator for example.

On other (non-RDF-aware) hosts, it is very likely that only numerical
input fields will appear in place of drop-down lists. In this case,
the mapping is simple: 0 means the first item in the list, 1 the
following and so on. However, no audio processing ability is involved,
so the plugins should perform the same way even with a somewhat
lacking GUI.

To support easy spotting/selection of the TAP-plugins in a plugin
selection dialog loaded with lots of other available plugins (and to
achieve consistency), every plugin's name starts with the letters
TAP. The actual name of the plugin follows after a space.

The audio processing algorithms done by TAP-plugins are coded to be
independent of the actual sample rate. The sample rate is always a
parameter during computations. The plugins have been tested with
sample rates 44.1 kHz and 96 kHz, as the author uses these values in
his studio. Please note that although all plugins should be
essentially functional at virtually any sample rate, the audio
fidelity depends slightly on the actual sample rate used. Higher
sample rate is better, of course. This means that an equalizer or
reverberator plugin will produce higher quality output, and will sound
a bit smoother at 96 kHz compared to, say, 44.1 kHz. This is a natural
effect that results from the fundamental properties of digital signal
processing, but you should be aware of it nevertheless.
