Description: Decompression compatible with pkunzip
DescDetail: <<
Zip is different from gzip in that it allows packing multiple files into a
single archive (without the assistance of tar). It is compatible with pkzip,
pkunzip, and other Windows zip utilities.

This utility is necessary to install several packages in a pure Darwin
installation, as Darwin does not come with zip/unzip.
