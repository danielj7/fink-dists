Description: Program for creating and studying hyperbolic 3-manifolds
DescDetail: <<
 SnapPea is Jeff Weeks' computational tool for mathematicians working in 
 low-dimensional topology. It is used for creating and studying hyperbolic 
 3-manifolds, and is accessible via Python scripts as well as through a 
 traditional graphical user interface.

 This package contains only the Python interface, using 
 the Python framework from Mac OS X.
 
 It uses the improved Python interface by Marc Culler and Nathan Dunfield
 from http://www2.math.uic.edu/~t3m/
<<
DescUsage: <<
 The %p/bin/SnapPeaPython script starts python with SnapPea already imported.
 The example from the SnapPeaScripting documentation can be started by

    cd %p/share/doc/snappea-nox
    SnapPeaPython
    >>> t = Triangulation('MyFile')

 For other examples, see the README file.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
 Uses Apple's Python, therefore no dependencies on other Fink packages.
 The SnapPea Python module is installed into %p/Library/Python so as not to 
 pollute system directories like /Library/Python. The downside is
 that one needs to set the PYTHONPATH env var in order to find the
 module. This is done in the %p/bin/SnapPeaPython wrapper script.
