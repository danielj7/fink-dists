Type: perl
# given Dist:10.6+, we have "perl" as 5.10.0+, which includes M::B and
# version modules in-core so don't need dependencies on them or to be
# varianted (to allow dep on version-pmXXX). Lower Dist would require
# varianting, which would be a messy scandeps.pl update route
#BuildDepends: module-build-pm
#Depends: version-pm%type_pkg[perl]

 Some tests are skipped if no Module::Pluggable. Not asserting a
 TestDepends because module-pluggable-pmXXX is perl-versioned.

 Some tests are skipped if no prefork. Not asserting a
 TestDepends because prefork-pmXXX is perl-versioned.

	%N-bin splitoff merged back into %N as of 0.89-2
