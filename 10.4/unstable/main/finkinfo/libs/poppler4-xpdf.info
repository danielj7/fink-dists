DescDetail: Poppler is a PDF rendering library based on the xpdf-3.0 code base.
DescPackaging: <<
	This is just the older-interface headers, which are installed
	by poppler iff it's configured with --enable-xpdf-headers. We
	just hack the makefiles we need and use just the xpdf headers
	parts of them instead of actually building the poppler package
	and stripping out the parts we don't need.
