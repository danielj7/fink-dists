DescDetail: <<
Valgrind is an award-winning instrumentation framework for building dynamic
analysis tools.  There are Valgrind tools that can automatically detect
many memory management and threading bugs, and profile your programs in
detail.  You can also use Valgrind to build new tools.

The Valgrind distribution currently includes six production-quality tools:
a memory error detector, two thread error detectors, a cache and
branch-prediction profiler, a call-graph generating cache profiler, and a
heap profiler.  It also includes one experimental tool, which detects out
of bounds reads and writes of stack, global and heap arrays.
