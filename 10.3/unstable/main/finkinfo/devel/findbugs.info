DescDetail: <<
FindBugs is a program to find bugs in Java programs.  It looks for
instances of "bug patterns" --- code instances that are likely to be
errors.

Changes since version 0.6.9:

   * Added -conserveSpace option to reduce memory use at the expense
     of analysis precision
   * Bug fixes in findbugs.bat script: JAVA_HOME handling, autodetection
     of FINDBUGS_HOME, missing output with -textui
   * Fixed NullPointerException when a missing class is encountered

Changes since version 0.6.6:

   * The null pointer dereference detector is more powerful
   * Significantly improved heuristics and bug fixes in inconsistent
     synchronization detector
   * Improved heuristics in open stream and dropped exception detectors;
     fewer false positives should be reported
   * Save HTML summary in XML results files, rather than recomputing;
     this makes loading results in GUI much faster
   * Report at most one String comparison using == or != per method
   * The findbugs.bat script on Windows autodetects FINDBUGS_HOME, and
     doesn't open a DOS window when launching the GUI (contributed by
     TJSB)
   * Emacs reporting format (contributed by David Li)
   * Various bug fixes
