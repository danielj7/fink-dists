# Install Phase:
DocFiles: AUTHORS COPYING ChangeLog INSTALL NEWS README
InstallScript: <<
 #!/bin/bash -ev  # Run as a script so that directory changes are preserved

 make install DESTDIR=%d

 ### Create and install the application bundle
 cd %b/packages/osx  # The make_osx_bundle script assumes it's being run from the %b/packages/osx directory
 ./make_osx_bundle.sh
 strip %i/bin/rapidsvn
 mv -f %i/bin/rapidsvn RapidSVN.app/Contents/MacOS/  # Move instead of copy because the program is useless outside of a bundle

 ### Install svncpp docu
 /usr/bin/install -d %i/share
 /usr/bin/install -d %i/share/doc
 /usr/bin/install -d %i/share/doc/svncpp0-doc
 cp -r %b/doc/svncpp/html %i/share/doc/svncpp0-doc

As part of the RapidSVN effort it became clear that it would make the code
easier to update and manage if the Subversion client C API were wrapped in C++.
This is where SvnCpp comes from. Right now it has the following aspects of the
C API have been abstracted: authentication, logging, status, notification, and
properties. SvnCpp should provide an object-oriented programming interface to
any project that uses C++ or a SWIG-compatible language like Python or Java.

# Additional Info
DescDetail: <<
RapidSVN is a cross-platform GUI front-end for the Subversion revision system
written in C++ using the wxWindows framework. This project also includes a
Subversion client C++ API.

DescPackaging: <<
	dmacks (0.9.4-12) make sure dist files are used in preference
	to anything from installed packages

	dmacks (0.9.4-12) svncpp uses svn headers, so make it also
	link against svn libs (otherwise users could link against an
	incompatible-svn's libs later)

	dmacks (0.9.4-12) avoid fink's openssl* (inherit -lssl from neon)
