Description: Simple "flash-card" type math game for kids
DescDetail: << 
MathWar is a stand-alone, gnome-based, math flash card game for children,
originally developed for the Linux platform. To read the manual, type

open %p/share/gnome/help/MathWar/C/manual.html

MathWar is more or less like playing with flash cards, with the exception
that there is a computer player who can attempt to answer if the human
player is too slow. A game of MathWar consists of a set number of rounds. A
round consists of two cards and a mathematical operator (add, subtract, or
multiplication). The first player to guess an answer for a round gets that
rounds point if the guess is correct. Otherwise, the correct answer is
displayed, and no points are awarded.
