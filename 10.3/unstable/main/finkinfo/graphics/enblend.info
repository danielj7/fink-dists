Description: Tool for compositing images
DescDetail: <<
Enblend is a tool for compositing images. Given a set of images that
overlap in some irregular way, Enblend overlays them in such a way that
the seam between the images is invisible, or at least very difficult to
see. Enblend does not line up the images for you. Use a tool like Hugin
to do that.
