Description: IPC library used by some GnuPG related software 
DescDetail: <<
Libassuan is a small library implementing the so-called Assuan protocol. 
This protocol is used for IPC between most newer GnuPG components. 
Both, server and client side functions are provided.

Assuan was developed for use by the GNU Privacy Guard, GnuPG, to prevent 
potentially buggy clients from unwittingly corrupting sensitive transactions 
or compromising data such as a secret key. Assuan permits the servers, which 
do the actual work, e.g. encryption and decryption of data using a secret key, 
to be developed independently of the user interfaces, e.g. mail clients and 
other encryption front ends. Like a shared library, the interface is well defined 
and any number of front ends can use it; however, unlike a shared library, 
the client cannot see or touch the server's data. As with any modular system, 
Assuan helps keep the servers small and understandable help to make code 
more understandable and less error prone.
