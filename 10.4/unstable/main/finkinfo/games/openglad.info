Description: Top-down gauntlet-style RPG
DescDetail: <<
	Openglad is a SDL port of an old DOS game called Gladiator,
	which was developed by FSGames in the mid 90's. FSGames donated
	 the original source for the DOS game under the GPL when one of 
	them found the earlier project (now abandoned in favor of this one)
	to make a full Gladiator clone.
	Gladiator is a top-down gauntlet-style RPG. In it, you hire team mates,
	go on missions, and improve your team with the spoils you reap. It can
	be played by up to 4 players (using split-screen), and comes with a
	scenario editor.
