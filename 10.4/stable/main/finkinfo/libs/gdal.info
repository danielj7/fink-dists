Description: Raster/Vector Geospatial Format Translator

Maintainer: BABA Yoshihiko <babayoshihiko@mac.com>
DescDetail: <<
GDAL is a translator library for raster geospatial data formats. As a library,
it presents a single abstract data model to the calling application for all
supported formats.

Current translators include GeoTIFF (read/write), Erdas Imagine (read),
ESRI .BIL (read/write), .aux labelled raw (read/write), DTED (read),
SDTS DEM (read), CEOS (read), JPEG (read/write), PNG (read/write),
Geosoft GXF (read), Arc/Info Binary Grid (read), FITS (read/write),
netCDF (limited read/write), and GIF (read/write).

The current version of GDAL come with the related OGR library (which lives 
within the GDAL source tree) provides a similar capability for simple features 
vector data.

The OGR Simple Features Library is a C++ open source library (and commandline 
tools) providing read (and sometimes write) access to a variety of vector file 
formats including ESRI Shapefiles, S-57, SDTS, PostGIS, Oracle Spatial, and 
Mapinfo mid/mif and TAB formats.

DescPackaging: <<
--with-ogdi is enabled since 1.2.6-5.
Python support is added since 1.2.6-4 as another package.
--with-geos is enabled since 1.2.6-1.

Previous versions of this package were maintained by Matt Stephenson
<cattrap@users.sourceforge.net> and Blair Zajac <blair@orcaware.com>.
<<

DescPort: <<
The large number of gdal include files are moved into their own
subdirectory and gdal-conf has been patched to have the correct
include file path. - Now successfully builds without this patch, though.

Uses -Os, otherwise it compiles with no optimization.

Uses --with-local=%p in ConfigureParams to have -I%p/include and
-L%p/lib be used in compiling this package.  But even with this set,
not all files are compiled with -I%p/include and so this is put in
SetCFLAGS and SetCXXFLAGS.

Uses --with-static-proj4=%p in ConfigureParams, but libproj still ends
up linking dynamically.

Uses --with-hdf4=no in ConfigureParams to avoid a compile error in
EHapi.c.

Franks Warmerdam says using the "internal" settings should not be
necessary, as the libs are tested to see if they are compatible.

TODO:

There are lots of other formats/libs that could be enabled, but have
not yet been tried.
