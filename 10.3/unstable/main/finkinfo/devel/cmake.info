Description: Cross-platform Make
DescDetail: <<
CMake is used to control the software compilation process using simple 
platform and compiler independent configuration files. CMake generates 
native makefiles and workspaces that can be used in the compiler 
environment of your choice. CMake is quite sophisticated: it is possible 
to support complex environments requiring system configuration,
pre-processor generation, code generation, and template instantiation.

 Previous versions by Sylvain Cuaz.
 
 The right install_name has to be introduced by hand, 
 the INSTALLNAME_DIR mechanism which is present in this version
 still does not work.
