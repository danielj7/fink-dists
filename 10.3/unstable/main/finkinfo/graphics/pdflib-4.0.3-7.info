Description: Library for generating PDF
DescDetail: <<
 PDFlib is a development tool for PDF-enabling your software, 
 or generating PDF on your server. 
<<
DescPort: <<
Uses patched configure from pdflib web site.
Force use of gcc2 - gcc3 compiles fine, but results
in segfault when used with grace.

We now build only a static library and no shared library.  The license of 
this package wouldn't allow us to distribute the shared library, but does
allow us to link the static library into other programs and then 
distribute those other programs.
