DescDetail: <<
SML/NJ is an implementation of the Standard ML programming language,
produced and maintained by researchers at Bell Labs, Princeton, Yale,
and AT&T Research.  This package includes the runtime system only --
it provides garbage collection and other support for compiled SML
programs.

Install this package if you want to run programs written in SML.
<<
DescUsage: <<
End users will not use this package directly.  It installs one
executable (smlnj-runtime) and one shell script (smlnj-script) in
bin/.  These are used to run other programs written in SML -- invoking
them on their own is rarely useful.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
I ignored the installation script provided by Bell Labs.  I also wrote
the smlnj-script, which looks for a "heap file" with the same name as
$0 in <ROOT>/lib/smlnj/ and then invokes smlnj-runtime with the
requisite arguments.  To package an SML program as an executable,
please place the heap file in <ROOT>/lib/smlnj/ and then create a
symlink to smlnj-script with the program name.
