Description: HTTP/WebDAV client library with a C API
DescDetail: <<
Current features:

 - High-level interface to HTTP and WebDAV methods.
 - Low-level interface to HTTP request handling, to allow implementing
   new methods easily.
 - Persistent connection support (HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/1.0 aware)
 - Basic and digest authentication (RFC2617) (including auth-int, md5-sess)
 - Proxy support (including basic/digest authentication)
 - Generic WebDAV 207 XML response handling mechanism
 - XML parsing using expat or libxml parser
 - Easy generation of error messages from 207 error responses
 - Basic HTTP/1.1 methods: GET, PUT, HEAD, OPTIONS, conditional PUT
 - WebDAV resource manipulation: MOVE, COPY, DELETE, MKCOL.
 - WebDAV metadata support: set and remove properties (PROPPATCH), query
   any set of properties (PROPFIND).

Provides lower-level interfaces to directly implement new HTTP
methods, and higher-level interfaces so that you don't have to
worry about the lower-level stuff.
