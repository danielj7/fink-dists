Description: Scanner Access Now Easy
DescDetail: <<
SANE stands for "Scanner Access Now Easy" and is an application programming
interface (API) that provides standardized access to any raster image 
scanner hardware (flatbed scanner, hand-held scanner, video- and still-cameras,
frame-grabbers, etc.). The SANE API is public domain and its discussion and
development is open to everybody.

DescPort: <<
Removed sm3600 backend, it crashes, Removed dlcompat requirement upstream, 
trouble is, need to patch configure so it doesn't find libdl if it is installed.
