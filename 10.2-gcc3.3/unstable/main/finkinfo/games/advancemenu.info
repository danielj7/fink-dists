DescPort: <<
Doesn't work as a frontend for xmame, since SDL in fink uses aqua. If 
you know a way around this, let me know.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
Added patches to support $DESTDIR. Changed the default $DATADIR to 
%p/share/%n from %p/share/advance to avoid conflict with advancemame. 
Binary files advcfg and advv put in %i/share/%n/bin to avoid a conflict 
with identical files in advancemame. Man files for advcfg and advv put 
in %i/share/%n/man/man1.
<<
DescUsage: <<
The first invocation of advmenu sets up a configuration file at 
~/.advance/advmenu.rc. Edit this file to change preferences. The basic 
command is 'advmenu'. Standard directory for advancemame roms is either 
~/.advance/rom or %p/share/advancemame/rom.
