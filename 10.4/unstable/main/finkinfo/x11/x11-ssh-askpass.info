DescDetail: <<
This is an X11-based passphrase dialog for use with OpenSSH.  It is
intended to replace the Perl/Tk-based ssh-askpass dialog and
GNOME-based ssh-askpass dialog which formerly accompanied OpenSSH-1.2.
These dialogs are intended to be called from the ssh-add program and
not invoked directly.

The features of x11-ssh-askpass are as follows:

  - Configurable via the standard X resource mechanism
    (/usr/lib/X11/etc/app-defaults, ~/.Xdefaults, xrdb, etc.).
    
  - Requires only stock X11 libraries (libXt, libX11, libSM, libICE).
  
  - Can be configured to grab the keyboard and/or pointer (grabs the
    keyboard by default, not the pointer).
<<
DescUsage: <<
The user interface is somewhat different than most password/passphrase
dialogs and more similar to the X11-based passphrase dialog that
accompanies the regular SSH distribution.  Instead of a text field that
fills with asterisks or some other character as the user enters the
passphrase, a series of LED-like areas light up one-by-one with each
passphrase character entered, beginning from the lefthand edge of the
dialog. When they reach the righthand edge, they go dark one-by-one
again, and so on.  This gives the user feedback that passphrase
characters have been entered, but does not provide onlookers with a cue
as to the length of the passphrase.

Pressing the `OK' button accepts the passphrase (even if it is empty),
which is printed on the standard output, and the dialog exits with a
status of zero (success).  Pressing the `Cancel' button discards the
passphrase, and the dialog exits with non-zero status.

The following keystrokes work as expected:

  [Backspace] or [Delete]               Erase previous character
  [Control+U] or [Control+X]            Erase entire passphrase
  [Enter], [Control+M], or [Control+J]  Accept passphrase (OK)
  [Escape]                              Discard passphrase (Cancel)
