Description: Allow XS extensions to depend on other XS
DescDetail: <<
  This module tries to make it easy to build Perl extensions that use functions
  and typemaps provided by other perl extensions. This means that a perl
  extension is treated like a shared library that provides also a C and an XS
  interface besides the perl one.
