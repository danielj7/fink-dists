Description: Generates man pages from program output.
DescDetail: <<
 help2man is intended to provide an easy way for software authors to
 include a manual page in their distribution without having to maintain 
 that document. Given a program which produces resonably standard --help 
 and --version outputs, help2man will attempt to re-arrange that output 
 into something which resembles a manual page.
