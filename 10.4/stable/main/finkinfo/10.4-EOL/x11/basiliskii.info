Description: Opensource 68k Mac emulator
DescDetail: <<
 BasiliskII is an opensource 68k Macintosh emulator. That is, it enables
you to run 68k MacOS software on you computer. It can run up to MacOS 8.1
depending on ROM image.
<<
DescUsage: <<
 Just type 'BasiliskII' at the command prompt inside an x environment. To
use Basilisk II, you need either a 512K Mac Classic ROM image or a 512K
or 1MB 32-bit clean Macintosh ROM image. You also need a copy of MacOS
(0.x thru 7.5 for Classic emulation, 7.x or 8.0/8.1 for Mac II emulation).
For copyright reasons, none of these items are included with Basilisk II.
MacOS 7.5.3 and earlier versions can be downloaded from Apple and various
other Internet sites. Mac ROM files are not freely available. You have to
own a real Mac and read out its ROM.
<<
DescPort: config.guess was updated to allow the host type to be recongised.
DescPackaging: <<
 Originally packaged by Matt Stephenson.

 This version is compiled with g++-3.3, even in the 10.4 tree.  If it is
 ever updated to a more recent compiler, any packages which depend on
 this one must be updated at the same time.
