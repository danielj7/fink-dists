DescDetail: <<
OpenHBCI is a client-side implementation of the HBCI specification. 
That means, you can use openHCBI in a homebanking application to connect 
and talk to any HBCI-capable bank server.

OpenHBCI provides an object oriented library to give you easy access to 
credit institutes that support the HBCI-standard. The library is written 
in C++, and C wrappers are provided as well. OpenHBCI hides all the 
protocol-stuff, the encryption, the communication... so that developers 
of homebanking-software can concentrate on their application without 
having to read about 700 pages of specification.
<<
DescPort: <<
Patch configure for building c++ shared libraries -bind_at_load, ltmain.sh for
the convenience library bug.
Does not depend on libchipcard, because I don't have a chipcard reader, nor
a driver for one.
