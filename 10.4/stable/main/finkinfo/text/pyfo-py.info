Revision: 1
Description: Generate XML from Python data structures

This module was developed by Luke Arno for Central Piedmont Community
College in response to dissatisfaction with available alternatives for
quickly generating XML. Concatenating strings is ugly and error prone,
using OO APIs for XML is heavy and overkill for generating simple XML
output.
