DescPort: <<
  Included libtool is *very* old and buggy, so we'll just start
  over instead of trying to patch it.

  Make sure to find pkg-config before trying to use it, and clarify
  diagnostics about what glib is being checked. Rip out glib1 detection:
  configure is regenerated from configure.in, and keeping it would mean
  we'd need BuildDepends:glib in order to get AM_PATH_GLIB. But make
  sure the results of AM_PATH_GLIB are patched into gdome-config.

  Don't put a .c's private variable in its .h file.
<<
DescUsage: <<
  The flags declared by pkg-config or gdomeConf.sh are for glib2; the
  flags declared by gdome-config are for glib1. The libgdome library
  in this package itself is linked against glib2. It (apparently)
  doesn't matter which one is used when linking against libgdome.
