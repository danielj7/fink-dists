Description: Comfortable terminal input library
DescDetail: <<
 The GNU Readline library provides a set of functions for use by
 applications that allow users to edit command lines as they are typed
 in. Both Emacs and vi editing modes are available. The Readline
 library includes additional functions to maintain a list of
 previously-entered command lines, to recall and perhaps reedit those
 lines, and perform csh-like history expansion on previous commands.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
 1) previous revisions by Christoph Pfisterer <chrisp@users.sourceforge.net>
 2) specify mandir & infodir
 3) the symbolic links from libreadline.4.2.dylib and libhistory.4.2.dylib are 
    needed for backward compatibility.  Future versions will also need links
    from libreadline.4.3.dylib and libhistory.4.3.dylib (due to the way
    things were done in readline-4.3-1 and readline-4.3-2).
<<
DescPort: <<
 1) patch doc/Makefile.in to use the correct flag for fink's version of
    install-info
 2) set the compatibility-version to 4.2.0 to agree with previous versions of 
    the readline package
 3) (dmrrsn) patch SHLIB_XLDFLAGS to use the correct -install_name flag when 
    building shared libs. (This patch has been submitted upstream.)
 4) (beren) patch SHLIB_LIBS to work around problem with 10.2 linker
