Description: 2D ASCII-art shooter
DescDetail: <<
0verkill is bloody 2D action deathmatch-like game in ASCII-ART running under 
Linux, OS/2 and Windows (and now, Darwin).

Throw away Doom, Quake and Duke Nukem - 0verkill comes. 
Now you don't even need graphic mode if you wanna take a bloody 
deathmatch with your friends.

The ASCII art that has always fascinated you started to move finally. 
No one has ever thought that ASCII is an animable kind of art. 
Finally you can taste the original appearance of elaborate action in 
full 16 colors of your plain old text terminal. 
You never thought that ASCII letters are capable of network-game 
action in such a massive manner.

No one ever connected gushing blood with that innocent ASCII letters that 
were so utterly boring until short recently, when 0verkill was released. 
<<
