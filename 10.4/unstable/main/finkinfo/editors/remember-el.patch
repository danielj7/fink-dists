+The main command is `remember'.  See the commentary at the top of
+@PREFIX@/share/emacs/site-lisp/remember/remember.el for more
+information.
+
+Although this package can be used by itself, its value grows
+considerably when combined with various packages, such as planner-el
+and org-mode.  (I actually don't know how to use remember on its own;
+I use it only with planner-el and org-mode.)
+
+The emacs customization group for remember-el is simply `remember'.
+Thus, to begin customizing, execute the key sequence
+
+  M-x customize-group RET remember RET
+
+Enjoy!
