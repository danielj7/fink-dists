Description: GNU EDA -- Electronics design software -- attribute editor

DescDetail: <<
GNU Electronic Design Automation software.

Gattrib is gEDA's attribute editor. It reads a set of gschem .sch files
(schematic files), and creates a spreadsheet showing all components in
rows, with the associated component attributes listed in the columns. It
allows the user to add, modify, or delete component attributes outside of
gschem, and then save the .sch files back out. When it is completed, it
will allow the user to edit attributes attached to components, nets, and
pins. (Currently, only component attribute editing is implemented; pin
attributes are displayed only, and net attributes are TBD.)

Gattrib is useful in situations where you need to view, add, modify, or
delete a number of attributes all at once. It saves you the pain of
clicking on each component and repeatedly using gschem's attribute editor
to modify component attributes. For example, if you create a large design
with generic components, and then later want to attach "footprint"
attributes to your components, it is a real hassle to do so using gschem.
In this situation, you can run gattrib on your design files to attach the
"footprint" attributes all at once using an easy-to-use spreadsheet.
