Description: Set of utilities to manage your TV viewing 
DescDetail: <<
  XMLTV is a set of utilities to manage your TV viewing. They work with TV
  listings stored in the XMLTV format, which is based on XML. The idea is
  to separate out the backend (getting the listings) from the frontend
  (displaying them for the user), and to implement useful operations like
  picking out your favourite programmes as filters that read and write XML
  documents. 

  There are two backends at present, grabbing TV listings for three different
  countries. There are filters to sort the listings by date, to remove shows
  that have already been broadcast, and a CGI script to semi-automatically
  pick things to watch. There are a couple of backends to produce printed
  output. 

  This software is still being developed and requires familiarity with a
  command line; but it does work.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
As of 0.5.57 AKH reverted the nomenclature back to "xmltv" and set the package
to use the system's Perl--all of the executable scripts encoded "/usr/bin/perl",
so we'd have to have Distribution-separated versions anyway.

Separate 10.4, 10.5, and 10.6 versions because of the different system Perls.
