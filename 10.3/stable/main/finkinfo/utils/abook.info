DescUsage: <<
 For help, use the question mark inside abook. Numbers are used
 to access a given field while editing a contact. To cycle through
 fields, use h. See the man page abook (1) for details.
 When importing a file, be aware that shortcut for home directory
 is not recognized, but good news, spaces in filenames are recognized.
 There is an optional sample.abookrc file in %p/share/doc/abook.
 If you want to use/customize it, copy it to $(HOME)/.abook/ and
 rename it abookrc. See the man page abookrc (5) for details.
 For launching url, default browser is lynx, but you can define it
 in abookrc as open to launch your preferred Mac OS X browser.
 See the README file in %p/share/doc/abook to customize your 
 $(HOME)/.muttrc file so that you can request an email address 
 from abook.
 See also the FAQ in %p/share/doc/abook for encoding conversion.

DescPort: <<
 The --with-readline option makes it compiled on Mac OS X.
 Added libncursesw5, since it is for widec (mutt integration).
 Added --disable-dependency-tracking to speed up build.
 Changed dependency to readline5.
