Description: TeX-based WYSIWYG editor
DescDetail: <<
 GNU TeXmacs is a free scientific text editor, which was both inspired
 by TeX and GNU Emacs. The editor allows you to write structured
 documents via a wysiwyg (what-you-see-is-what-you-get) and user
 friendly interface. New styles may be created by the user. The program
 implements high-quality typesetting algorithms and TeX fonts, which
 help you to produce professionally looking documents.

 The high typesetting quality still goes through for automatically
 generated formulas, which makes TeXmacs suitable as an interface for
 computer algebra systems. TeXmacs also supports the Guile/Scheme
 extension language, so that you may customize the interface and write
 your own extensions to the editor.

DescPort:<<
 This version still needs a small patch file to address two things:
 - A typo in a make file 
   (a space between -L and the corresponding lib directory)
 - A non-working linker option in a darwin-specific part of configure. 
   This was probably introduced by me in the first place :-(
 I expect that both patches will not be necessary in future versions.
 TeXmacs uses wget for getting online help files; the package depends
 therefore on wget.

DescUsage:<<
 Provides a unified GUI for maxima, macaulay2, octave, pari-gp 
 if they are installed. 
 No configuration necessary, they are auto-detected at program startup.
