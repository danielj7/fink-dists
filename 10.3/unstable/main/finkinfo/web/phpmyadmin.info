Description: Web interface to MySQL
DescDetail: <<
 phpMyAdmin is a tool written in PHP intended to handle the
 administration of MySQL over the WWW. Currently it can create and drop
 databases, create/drop/alter tables, delete/edit/add fields, execute
 any SQL statement, manage keys on fields. 
<<
DescUsage: <<
 Configuration files coming from before phpMyAdmin 2.3.0 (released on 
 2002-08-11) are no longer supported.

 You can still use your config.inc.php file, but this file can be
 simplified, containing only the parameters you want to change from
 their corresponding default value in config.default.php
 The settings host, auth_type, user, password, and PmaAbsoluteUri are required.
 See the file %p/share/doc/phpmyadmin/Documentation.html for details.
 To access the interface, open the directory /sw/share/phpmyadmin in your 
 browser.
 You must have php enabled in your apache conf file. 
 You may wish to add a symlink to there like so:
 ln -s %p/share/phpmyadmin /Library/WebServer/Documents/phpmyadmin
 
 If you do not have a remote MySQL server, you should install the "mysql" 
 package as well as the client.
 
 If you get strange collation errors with MySQL 4.1.2, use the script:
 %p/share/%n/scripts/upgrade_tables_mysql_4_1_2+.sql
