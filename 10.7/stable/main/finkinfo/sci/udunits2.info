Description: Manipulation units of physical quantities
DescPackaging: <<
Decided not just to use the "udunits" name, since this version builds 
shared libraries out of the box, and none of its files actually overlap
with the prior version's.

DescDetail: <<
The UDUNITS-2 package provides support for units of physical quantities. 
Its three main components are: 
	1) a C library for units of physical quantities; 
	2) a utility; for obtaining the definition of a unit and for 
		converting numeric values between compatible units; and
	3) an extensive database of units.
