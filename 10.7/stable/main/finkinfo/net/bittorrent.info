Description: Tool for distributing files
DescDetail: <<
  BitTorrent is a tool for distributing files. It's extremely
  easy to use - downloads are started by clicking on hyperlinks.
  Whenever more than one person is downloading at once
  they send pieces of the file(s) to each other, thus relieving
  the central server's bandwidth burden. Even with many
  simultaneous downloads, the upload burden on the central server
  remains quite small, since each new downloader introduces new
  upload capacity.

  This package contains the tools which are used for console-only
  downloading.  If you want the GUI interface, install the
  bittorrent-gui package.
