Description: SNMP agent for PostgreSQL
DescDetail: <<
pgsnmpd is an SNMP agent for PostgreSQL which implements RDBMS-MIB, as
defined in RFC 1697.  This MIB was developed by a group of representatives
from different database manufacturers, and describes various attributes
common to most relational database management systems.  Because it was
designed as the least common denominator, it doesn't show very much detail
and there are definitely a number of things RDBMS-MIB doesn't cover that
PostgreSQL administrators would be very interested in.  Future versions of
pgsnmpd will support a second MIB, tentatively called PGSQL-MIB, in addition
to RDBMS-MIB.  This PGSQL-MIB will be PostgreSQL-specific, and will include
many more data points of interest to PostgreSQL users and administrators.
