Description: Tool that connects programs written in C, C++ with a variety of high-level programming languages.
DescDetail:<< 
SWIG is a software development tool that connects programs written in C,
C++, and Objective-C with a variety of high-level programming languages.
SWIG is primarily used with common scripting languages such as Perl, 
Python, Tcl/Tk, Ruby, and Guile but has also been extended to include
languages such as Java and Eiffel. SWIG is most commonly used to create
high-level interpreted programming environments and as a tool
for building user interfaces.
