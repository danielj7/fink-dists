Description: Spectral decomp. of irregular time series
DescDetail: <<
A package implementing tools to compute spectral decompositions of
irregularly-spaced time series. Currently includes functions based off the
Lomb-Scargle periodogram and Adolf Mathias' implementation for R and C (see
http://www.jstatsoft.org/v11/i02).

This package provides the following functions:
Windowing:
        cubicwgt
Periodogram:
        lombcoeff
        lombnormcoeff
Accelerated time-series functions:
        fastlscomplex
Complex time-series functions:
        lscomplex
Real time-series functions:
        lsreal
Correlation:
        lscorrcoeff
Wavelet Transform:
        lswaveletcoeff

<<

DescPackaging: <<
Common for all octave-forge packages:

We read in postinst and prerm template scripts installed by octaveN and modify
them to use the name of this package because Octave's package manager can't 
cope with non-literal arguments.

The Type: forge (pkgname) is used to minimize what needs to be changed when
using this .info file as a template, or when the package name contains 
underscores.
