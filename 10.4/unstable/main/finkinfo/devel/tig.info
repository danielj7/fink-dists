Description: Ncurses git repository browser
DescDetail: <<
	Tig allows you to browse changes in a git repository and can
	additionally act as a pager for output of various git commands. When
	used as a pager, it will display input from stdin and colorize it.

	When browsing repositories, tig uses the underlying git commands to
	present the user with various views, such as summarized commit log and
	showing the commit with the log message, diffstat, and the diff.
