Description: CSS editor
DescDetail: <<
 CSSED is a small editor that tries to ease the CSS editing.
 It features autocompletion, CSS syntax validation, selector
 wizard for complex rules, color wizard, box wizard, and
 other useful features to help web developers to create and 
 maintain CSS style sheets.
 It has also dialogs and toolbar icons for most used css 
 tags, css2 reference browser fully clickable to easy 
 integration in style sheet, as well as selector scanning 
 to quick change of property value, quick access via 
 temporary bookmarks, and digest view.
 Color syntax highlighting for various file types, program
 output, temporary and permanent scratch-pads completes the
 software.
 There are also some extras on the web site, especially the
 emacs launcher (others do not work at the time being),
 which allows cssed to be launched from emacs/xemacs.
<<
DescUsage: <<
 See the man(1) page for more information.
 You can customize the cssed-def.xml CSS definition file 
 by copying it from %p/share/cssed/data to your home directory.
 For more information, see the homepage.
 There are also add-ons as separate packages for terminal, 
 file browser, search within and outside of cssed, and tags 
 editing.
<<
DescPort: <<
 Use of pkgconfig (location of gtk+2, glib+2).
 Add --mandir=%p/share/man to get correct installation of man page
 Create a dev SplitOff to comply with policy though the package
 installs only a binary, some headers and a pc file. 
 Patch the pc file and the main Makefile so that the headers
 get installed in the right directory.
