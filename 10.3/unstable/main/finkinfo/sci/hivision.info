Description: Visualization platform 
DescDetail: <<
HiVision is a visualization platform including advanced visualization
techniques for the analysis and exploration of data supplied by numerical
simulation. Although primarily developed for visualisation in the area of
computational fluid dynamics as part of the HiFlow project , the HiVision
framework is discipline independent and may be advantageously used in
various areas such as structural mechanics and reactive flow simulation. 
HiVision has been developed using the powerful C++ Visualization
Toolkit library (VTK) and for the graphical user interface, the Qt. 

The main features supported in release 2.0 are the following:

 2D/3D unstructured grids (quadrangles, hexahedra, triangles, tetrahedra)
 Scalar data: texture mapping, transparency, colorbar, cutplanes, isolines, isosurfaces
 Vector data: interactive creation, streamlines, pathlines
 Stereo rendering
 Animation (based on MPEG)
 Mouse based interaction

DescUsage: <<
 Simply run "hivisionmain".
 Two example data sets are in %p/share/doc/hivision/Examples
<<
DescPort: <<
 get_mem_info and some other gcc-3.3-related problems are now corrected 
 in the upstream sources.
 The patch file contains only some config info.
