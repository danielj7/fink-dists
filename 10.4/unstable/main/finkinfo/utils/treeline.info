Do you have lots of sticky notes lying around with various useful 
information jotted down? Or many lists of books, movies, website 
logins, personal contacts, or things to do? Can you find them when
you need them? Well, I often couldn't. So here's my answer.
Some would call TreeLine an Outliner, others would call it a PIM. 
Basically, it just stores almost any kind of information. A tree 
structure makes it easy to keep things organized. And each node 
in the tree can contain several fields, forming a mini-database. 
The output format for each node can be defined, and the output can 
be shown on the screen, printed, or exported to html.
