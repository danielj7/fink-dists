Description: User-friendly manager for ssh-agent
DescDetail: <<
 Keychain is a shell script which acts as user-friendly front-end to
 ssh-agent and gpg-agent, allowing you to have long-running agent
 processes per system rather than per login session.
<<
DescUsage: <<
 Please study the documentation on the keychain website carefully
 since incorrect usage of this script may have certain security
 implications.

 Upgrading from versions earlier than 2.0:

 Support files are now stored in ~/.keychain so you will have to
 update your ~/.login script accordingly.
