Description: Source code tag system for C, C++, Java, and Yacc
DescDetail: <<
GNU GLOBAL is a source code tag system that works the same way across
diverse environments. You can locate a specified object in the source
files and move there easily. It is useful for hacking a large project
containing many subdirectories, many #ifdef and many main()
functions. It is similar to ctags or etags but is different from them
at the point of independence of any editor.
