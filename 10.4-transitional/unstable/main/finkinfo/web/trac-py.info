Description: Web-based software project management sytem
DescDetail: <<
Trac is an enhanced wiki and issue tracking system for software development 
projects. Trac uses a minimalistic approach to web-based software project 
management. 

Our mission; to help developers write great software while staying out of the 
way.
<<
DescUsage: <<

Trac will use pysqlite2 in preference to pysqlite.  If you install 
pysqlite2 after creating a pysqlite trac database, you will need to
update your trac database:

  $ mv trac.db trac2.db
  $ sqlite trac2.db .dump | sqlite3 trac.db

*** To setup Trac with apache, the following lines should be added to your 
Apache httpd.conf file:

Alias /trac "@FINK_PREFIX@/share/trac/htdocs/"
#You have to allow people to read the files in htdocs
<Directory "@FINK_PREFIX@/share/trac/htdocs">
        Options Indexes MultiViews
        AllowOverride None
        Order allow,deny
        Allow from all
</Directory>

<Location "/cgi-bin/trac.cgi">
        SetEnv TRAC_ENV @PROJECT_LOCATION@
</Location>

# You need something like this to authenticate users
<Location "/cgi-bin/trac.cgi/login">
        AuthType Basic
        AuthName @PROJECT_NAME@
        AuthUserFile @PASSWORD_FILE@
        Require valid-user
</Location>

Replace @PROJECT_NAME@ with the name of your project, and @PASSWORD_FILE@
with the location of your htpasswd file, e.g. %p/var/apache2/trac.htpasswd
Also replace @PROJECT_LOCATION@ with the location of your Trac repository,
which can be created using trac-admin. @FINK_PREFIX@ should also be replaced
with the location of your Fink installation.

*** In order to get the trac.cgi file working, you should copy the
@FINK_PREFIX@/share/trac/cgi-bin/trac.cgi file to 
/Library/WebServer/CGI-Executables/ .

*** Further configuration information is available at
http://projects.edgewall.com/trac/wiki/

*** In order to have syntax highlighting in the Trac web pages, the
silvercity-py22|23|24 package needs to be installed.
