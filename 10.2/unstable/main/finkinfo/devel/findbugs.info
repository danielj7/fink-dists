DescDetail: <<
FindBugs is a program to find bugs in Java programs.  It looks for
instances of "bug patterns" --- code instances that are likely to be
errors.

Changes since 0.6.5:

  * Rewritten inconsistent synchronization detector; accuracy is
    significantly improved, and bug reports are prioritized
  * New detector to find self assignment (x=x) of local variables
    (suggested by Jeff Martin)
  * New detector to find calls to wait(), notify(), and notifyAll()
    on an object which is not obviously locked
  * Open stream detector now reports Readers and Writers
  * Fixed bug in finalizer idioms detector which caused spurious warnings
    about failure to call super.finalize() (reported by Jim Menard)
  * Fixed bug where output stream was not closed using non-XML output
    (reported by Sigiswald Madou)
  * Fixed corrupted HTML bug detail message (reported by Trevor Harmon)
