GnuPG is GNU's tool for secure communication and data
storage. It can be used to encrypt data and to create digital
signatures. It includes an advanced key management facility and is
compliant with the proposed OpenPGP Internet standard as described in
RFC2440.

Now that the IDEA patent has expired, no need for a separate package
that does not contain it.
