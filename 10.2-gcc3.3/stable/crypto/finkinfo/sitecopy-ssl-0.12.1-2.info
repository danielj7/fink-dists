Description: Web site uploader
DescDetail: <<
sitecopy keeps your web site in sync with a local directory. It
uploads new or changed files and delete obsolete file from the
server. It supports FTP and WebDAV.

The GNOME frontend is packaged separately as xsitecopy.

This package builds SSL support, use sitecopy instead if
you don't need it. 
<<
DescPort: <<
Uses autoconf, but custom Makefiles. Not all Makefiles
use CPPFLAGS, so we put the include path in CFLAGS, too.
