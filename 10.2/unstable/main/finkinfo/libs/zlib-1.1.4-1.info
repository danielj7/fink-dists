Description: Compression library
DescDetail: <<
zlib allows you to integrate the deflate compression (also used by
gzip and zip) into your programs.
<<
DescPort: <<
Doesn't use autoconf. Comes with a self-built configure
script. Patched to support Darwin, but only builds a shared library.

The patch makes sure that z_off_t is always defined as long. Without
the patch, zconf.h defines it as long (4 bytes) or off_t (8 bytes on
Darwin), depending on whether HAVE_STDLIB_H is defined. This led to
serious compatibility problems with the shared library. Apple's
libz.dylib also uses a 4 byte type.
