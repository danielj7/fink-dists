DescDetail: <<
This package makes the qhull library (www.qhull.org) available in R,
in a similar manner as in Octave and MATLAB. Qhull computes convex
hulls, Delaunay triangulations, halfspace intersections about a point,
Voronoi diagrams, furthest-site Delaunay triangulations, and furthest-site
Voronoi diagrams. It runs in 2-d, 3-d, 4-d, and higher dimensions. It
implements the Quickhull algorithm for computing the convex hull. Qhull
does not support constrained Delaunay triangulations, or mesh generation
of non-convex objects, but the package does include some R functions that
allow for this. Currently the package only gives access to Delaunay
triangulation and convex hull computation.
