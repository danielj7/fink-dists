Description: Instant Messaging client (with SSL)
DescDetail: <<
Gaim is a clone of AOL's Instant Messenger client. It features
nearly all of the functionality of the official AIM client while
also being smaller and faster. Gaim also has plugins that let
you use ICQ, Yahoo, MSN, IRC, Jabber, Napster, and Zephyr.
<<
DescPort: <<
Changed default browser to "open %s" (which invokes the user's default browser).
Had to set the optimizations down from -O2 to -O to work around an Apple gcc3 bug.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
Includes fixes for several severe security flaws.

BuildDependsOnly is false because plugins may need the headers.
