DescDetail: <<
IceS is a source client for a streaming server.
The purpose of this client is to provide an audio stream to a streaming server
such that one or more listeners can access the stream. With this layout, this
source client can be situated remotely from the icecast server.

The primary example of a streaming server used is Icecast 2, although others
could be used if certain conditions are met.
