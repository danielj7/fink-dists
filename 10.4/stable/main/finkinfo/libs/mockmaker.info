Description: Generate mock object source code
DescDetail: <<
MockMaker is a program for creating source code for mock object classes.
Given an interface, it writes the source code for a mock object class
that implements the interface and allows instances of that class to have
expectations set about how many times a method is called, what parameters
each method is called with, and to pre-set return values for methods.  In
many cases (possibly most cases), the classes produced by MockMaker are
exactly what you want a mock class to do.
