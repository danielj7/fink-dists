Description: Python module to help you manage your bits
DescDetail: <<
	bitstring is a pure Python module designed to help make the creation,
	manipulation and analysis of binary data as simple and natural as
	possible.

	BitStrings can be constructed from integers (big and little endian),
	hex, octal, binary, strings or files. They can be sliced, joined,
	reversed, inserted into, overwritten, etc. with simple functions or
	slice notation. They can also be read from, searched and replaced, and
	navigated in, similar to a file or stream.
