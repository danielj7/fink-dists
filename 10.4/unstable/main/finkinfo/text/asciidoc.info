Description: Flexible, simple documentation markup system
DescDetail: <<
AsciiDoc is a text document format for writing articles, books, manuals and
UNIX man pages. AsciiDoc files can be translated to HTML (with or without
stylesheets), DocBook (articles, books and refentry documents) and LinuxDoc
using the asciidoc command. AsciiDoc can also be used to build and maintain
websites.

You write an AsciiDoc document the same way you would write a
normal text document, there are no markup tags or weird format notations.
AsciiDoc files are designed to be viewed, edited and printed directly or
translated to other presentation formats

In order to use a2x, you will need to install the asciidoc-a2x package, which
depends on the following additional packages: coreutils, libxslt-bin, lynx,
and getoptbin. You might also need to install 'fop'.
