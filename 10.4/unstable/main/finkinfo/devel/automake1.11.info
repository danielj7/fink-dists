Description: GNU Standards-compliant Makefile generator
DescDetail: <<
Automake is a tool for automatically generating `Makefile.in's from files 
called `Makefile.am'.

The goal of Automake is to remove the burden of Makefile maintenance from the 
back of the individual GNU maintainer (and put it on the back of the Automake 
maintainer).

The `Makefile.am' is basically a series of `make' macro definitions (with 
rules being thrown in occasionally). The generated `Makefile.in's are 
compliant with the GNU Makefile standards.

DescPackaging: <<
Apple's Python returns /Library/Python for 
python -c "import sys; from distutils import sysconfig;
sys.stdout.write(sysconfig.get_python_lib(0,0,prefix='/a/prefix'));"

Which causes a test failure (it should return a directory starting with
/a/prefix).

Filed as rdar://problem/6903801 which was duped to
rdar://problem/6132558 

Patch that was applied to upstream automake to work around this issue
is included in this package. Unless --prefix=/usr or below /System,
the python directory is chosen to be below --prefix, as an exception
to this (for the vendor) --prefix=/usr or below /System respects the
pythondir that python returns.
