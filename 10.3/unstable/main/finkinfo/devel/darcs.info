DescDetail: << 
Darcs is a revision control system, along the lines of CVS and arch.
That means that it keeps track of various revisions and branches of
your project, allows for changes to propagate from one branch to
another. Darcs is intended to be an ``advanced'' revision control
system.  Darcs has two particularly distinctive features which differ
from other revision control systems: 1) each copy of the source is a
fully functional branch, and 2) underlying darcs is a consistent and
powerful theory of patches.

Previous versions by Vadim Zaliva
The LDflags are because the makefile automatically adds a "-lcurses",
resulting otherwise in darcs being linked to both /sw/lib/libncurses
(via readline) and /usr/lib/libncurses.
And on some systems, this could lead to failure because of a version
mismatch between /usr/lib/libncurses and the needs of libreadline.
