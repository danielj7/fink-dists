DescDetail: <<
ml-burg generates a Standard ML program to perform bottom-up rewriting
of an input tree.  Cost information associated with each rewrite rule
is used to derive the minimum rewrite cost for the entire tree. A
successful reduction corresponds to rewriting the input tree to a
special non-terminal symbol called the "start" non-terminal. Upon
successful reduction, facilities are provided to walk the tree
emitting semantic actions corresponding to the rules that matched.

Install this package if you want to write a compiler in SML using 
a burg specification.
