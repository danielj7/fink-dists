Description: Portable Forth Environment
DescDetail: <<
The Portable Forth Environment (PFE) is based on the ANSI Standard for
Forth. The PFE has been created by Dirk-Uwe Zoller and had been
maintained up to the 0.9.x versions (1993-1995).  Tektronix has
adopted the PFE package in 1998 and made a number of extensions. It is
now fully multithreaded and it features a module system. You can load
additional C objects at runtime to extend the Forth dictionary. It is
best targeted for embedded environments since you can easily exchange
the terminal driver and the initilization routines.
