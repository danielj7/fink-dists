This module implements the Font::AFM class. Objects of this class are
initialised from an AFM-file and allows you to obtain information about the
font and the metrics of the various glyphs in the font.

All measurements in AFM files are given in terms of units equal to 1/1000 of
the scale factor of the font being used. To compute actual sizes in a document,
these amounts should be multiplied by (scale factor of font)/1000.
