Description: Building system for LaTeX documents
DescDetail: <<
This is a building system for LaTeX documents. It is based on a routine that
runs (hopefully) just as many compilations as necessary. The module system
provides a great flexibility that virtually allows support for any package with
no user intervention, as well as pre- and post-processing of the document. The
standard modules currently provide support for bibtex, dvips, pdftex,
makeindex, cweb and graphics/graphicx (currently with automatic epstopdf and
XFig picture conversion and Metapost compilation).
<<
DescPackaging: <<
Only uses python for scripting, so just use the system's version to save user
headaches.
