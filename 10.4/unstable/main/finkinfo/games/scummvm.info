Description: Engine for several graphical point-and-click adventure games
DescDetail: <<
	ScummVM is a 'virtual machine' for several classic graphical point-and-click 
	adventure games. It is designed to run Adventure Soft's Simon the 
	Sorcerer 1 and 2, Revolution's Beneath A Steel Sky, and games based on 
	LucasArts' SCUMM (Script Creation Utility for Maniac Mansion) system. 
	SCUMM is used for many games, including Monkey Island, Day of the 
	Tentacle, Sam and Max and more. See the official compatibility list at 
	<http://www.scummvm.org/compatibility/> for a full list of 
	supported games.
