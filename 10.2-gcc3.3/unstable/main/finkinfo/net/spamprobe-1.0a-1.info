Description: Spam filtering using Bayesian statistics
DescDetail: <<
 * Spam detection using Bayesian analysis of terms contained in each
   email.  Words used often in spams but not in good email tend to
   indicate that a message is spam.

 * Written in C++ for good performance.  Database access using
   BerkeleyDB for quick startup and fast term count retrieval.

 * Recognition and decoding of MIME attachments in quoted-printable
   and base64 encoding.  Automatically skips non-text attachments.
   MIME decoding enables SpamProbe to make decisions based on words in
   the emails rather than base64 gobbledigook.

 * Counts two word phrases as well as single words for higher
   precision.

DescPort: <<
  The db4 fink package puts its header files in /sw/include/db4 so a patch was
necessary to include <db4/db.h> instead of just <db.h>.
  Also, the configure script included with spamprobe does not seem to
recognise custom include directories, so a patch was necessary there also.
