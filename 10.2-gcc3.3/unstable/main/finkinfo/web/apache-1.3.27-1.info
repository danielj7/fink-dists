Description: Flexible and extensible web server
DescDetail: <<
Apache is an industrial grade web server. In fact, it is the number
one server on the net. It is modular and extensible, using dynamic
loading for modules.
<<
DescUsage: <<
Edit the configuration files in /sw/etc/httpd to fit your needs. You
may want to change the DocumentRoot to keep both you and the package
system happy. When you're ready, make sure the shipped webserver is
disabled and run 'daemonic enable apache' as root. That will create a
startup item that starts apache after the next reboot. You can also
start it manually via 'apachectl' (but be sure you get the right one).

To disable the server, run 'daemonic disable apache' as root. This
will not kill a running server at this time. If you don't know how to
kill the server yourself, reboot the machine to get rid of it.
