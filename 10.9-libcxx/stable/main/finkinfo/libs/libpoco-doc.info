DescDetail: <<
The POCO C++ Libraries are a collection of open source C++ class libraries 
that simplify and accelerate the development of network-centric, portable 
applications in C++. The libraries integrate perfectly with the C++ 
Standard Library and fill many of the functional gaps left open by it. 
Their modular and efficient design and implementation makes the POCO C++ 
Libraries extremely well suited for embedded development, an area where 
the C++ programming language is becoming increasingly popular, due to its 
suitability for both low-level (device I/O, interrupt handlers, etc.) and 
high-level object-oriented development.
