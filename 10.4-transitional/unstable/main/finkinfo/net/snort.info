Description: Open Source Network Intrusion Detection
DescDetail: <<
Snort is a lightweight network intrusion detection system, capable of performing real-time 
traffic analysis and packet logging on IP networks.  It  can perform protocol analysis, 
content searching/matching and can be used to detect a variety of attacks and probes, such 
as buffer overflows, stealth port scans, CGI attacks, SMB probes, OS fingerprinting attempts, 
and much more. Snort uses a flexible rules language to describe traffic that it should collect 
or pass, as well as a detection engine that utilizes a modular plugin architecture.  Snort has 
a real-time alerting capability as well, incorporating alerting mechanisms for syslog, a user 
specified file, a UNIX socket, or WinPopup messages to Windows clients using Samba's smbclient.
