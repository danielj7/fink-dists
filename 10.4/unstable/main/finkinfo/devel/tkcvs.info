# Additional Info
DescDetail: <<
TkCVS is a Tcl/Tk-based graphical interface to the CVS and
Subversion configuration management systems. It will also help with
RCS. The user interface is consistent across Unix/Linux, Windows,
and MacOS X. TkDiff is included for browsing and merging your
changes.

TkCVS shows the status of the files in the current working
directory, and has tools for tagging, merging, importing, exporting,
checking in/out, and other user operations.

TkCVS also aids in browsing the repository. For Subversion, the
repository tree is browsed like an ordinary file tree. For CVS, the
CVSROOT/modules file is read. TkCVS extends CVS with a method to
produce a "user friendly" listing of modules by using special
comments in the CVSROOT/modules file.

The graphical 2 and 3-way diff/merge tool TkDiff is included in this
package and can be used by itself.

It has integrated support for AccuRev/CM, CVS, Perforce, PVCS, RCS, 
SCCS, and SVN (subversion).
<<
DescUsage: <<
Remote repositories are supported, although the login step must 
be done at the commandline.

Then type 'tkcvs' to start up TkCVS

You can put personal preferences in a file called .tkcvs in your 
home directory.  User interface preferences should usually go there.

Type 'man tkcvs' to get help.
Type 'tkdiff' and open the help menu for more information about TkDiff.

TkDiff might also be used as an external diff command for Subversion (svn)
via an included wrapper. If you have svn installed add this line to your 
'~/.subversion/config' file under the '[helpers]' section:

diff-cmd = tkdiff-svn-wrapper
