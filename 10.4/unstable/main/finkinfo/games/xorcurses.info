Package: xorcurses
Version: 0.1.0
Revision: 1
Description: Game based on Xor
DescDetail: <<
	XorCurses is a game coded by jwm-art.net based entirely on Xor by
	Astral Software. The original game was released around 1987 for the 8
	bit home computers popular at the time. XorCurses attempts to
	faithfully recreate that game for Linux, but slightly ironically, uses
	ASCII characters instead of pixel based graphics (which even the 8bit
	computers could manage).
