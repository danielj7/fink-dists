Description: Layout program (development version 1.3.x)
DescDetail: << 
 Scribus is an open-source program that brings professional 
 page layout to Linux/Unix, MacOS X, OS/2 and Windows desktops 
 with a combination of "press-ready" output and new approaches 
 to page layout.

 Underneath the modern and user friendly interface, Scribus 
 supports professional publishing features, such as CMYK color, 
 separations, ICC color management and versatile PDF creation.
<<
DescUsage: <<
 This version contains extensive online help. 
 Additional up-to-date documentation is on the Scribus web site.

 Fonts: By default, the X11 Type1 fonts are recognized. If you
 want more fonts, you can do one or more of the following:
 - Install the x-ghostscript-fonts or msttcorefonts or xfonts-intl 
   or applesystemfont packages. 
   (The gimp-sharefonts and similar packages work, too, 
   but these fonts are of rather bad quality)
 - Put lines like
     /Library/Fonts
     /System/Library/Fonts
   into your ~/.scribus/scribusfont13.rc file (create it if it doesn't exist)
   This will give you many (not all) of the Apple system fonts.
   If you use FontBook to create your own collections, put also
     ~/Library/Fonts
   into this file.
 
   On Mac OSX 10.5, you might need to create a ~/.fonts.conf file
   that contains lines like
        <dir>/Library/Fonts</dir>
        <dir>/System/Library/Fonts</dir>
   etc.

  Note that scribus-1.3.x and scribus-1.2.x use incompatible file
  formats. So be careful when switching between these versions.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
 The default profiles folder is now populated with a minimal set
 of color profiles from /System/Library/ColorSync/Profiles/
 so that color management can be activated. 
<<
DescPort: <<
 This is the first stab at using Scribus' new cmake build system 
 in Fink. There might be some parts that don't yet work as they 
 did before...
 The CMake find mechanisms for python
 have to be overridden in order to find Fink's
 python2.5
