Package: roofitcore-%type_pkg[root_version]
Type: root_version (root4)
Description: Toolkit for modeling physics event distributions
DescDetail: <<
The core package provides tools to perform likelihood fits, produce
plots, and generate "toy Monte Carlo" samples for various physics studies. The
RooFit tools are integrated with the object-oriented and interactive
ROOT graphical environment.  

RooFit has been developed for the BaBar collaboration, a high energy
physics experiment at the  Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, and is
primarily targeted to the high-energy physicists using the ROOT
analysis environment, but the general nature of the package make it
suitable for adoption in different disciplines as well.

DescPackaging: <<
This package has a somewhat unorthodox split-off due to the fact that
root relies on a C++ interpreter. Thus the header files are needed to
run root interactively and it does not make sense to single the header
files out into another split-off (roofitcore-dev for example) which
cannot be declared BuildDependsOnly anyway.
