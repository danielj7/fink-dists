Description: Daemon to monitor GPS/AIS receivers

DescDetail: <<
You will likely want to install one of the version of gpsd-py to
get the programs gpscat, gpsfake, gpsprof, xgps, and xgpsspeed 
that are written in python.

gpsd is a service daemon that monitors one or more GPSes or AIS
receivers attached to a host computer through serial or USB ports,
making all data on the location/course/velocity of the sensors
available to be queried on TCP port 2947 of the host computer. With
gpsd, multiple location-aware client applications (such as
navigational and wardriving software) can share access to receivers
without contention or loss of data. Also, gpsd responds to queries
with a format that is substantially easier to parse than the NMEA 0183
emitted by most GPSes. The gpsd distribution includes a linkable C
service library, a C++ wrapper class, and a Python module that
developers of gpsd-aware applications can use to encapsulate all
communication with gpsd.

Besides gpsd itself, the project provides auxiliary tools for
diagnostic monitoring and profiling of receivers and feeding
location-aware applications GPS/AIS logs for diagnostic purposes.

The goal of the gpsd project is to create a solid layer of open-source
infrastructure for programs running under Linux and other open-source
Unixes that want to be location-sensitive. We aim for simple, robust
interfaces, unfussy operation, and an easy learning curve for
application developers.

2011-Jun Kurt Schwehr / goatbar:  We may want to add these options

--enable-gpsd-user=username 
--enable-gpsd-group=groupname

And not sure if we should try to support Qt.

Why does dbus not work?
