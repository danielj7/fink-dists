Description: Minimal file history tool
DescDetail: <<
The FHist package contains 3 utilities, a file history tool ``fhist'',
a file comparison tool ``fcomp'', and a file merging tool ``fmerge''. 
All three are bundled together, because they all use the same
minimal-difference algorithm.

For more details, see http://www.pcug.org.au/~millerp/fhist.html
<<
DescPort: <<
Explicitly set CFLAGS because the configure script was not finding
libintl.h in /sw/include

The build depends on groff, but works with either the fink groff
package or the Apple supplied /usr/bin/groff.
