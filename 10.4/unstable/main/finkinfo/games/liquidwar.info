Description: Unique multiplayer wargame
DescDetail: <<
	Liquid War is a unique multiplayer wargame. Its rules are truly original
	and have been invented by Thomas Colcombet. You control an army of liquid
	and have to try and eat your opponents. A single player mode is available,
	but the game is definitely designed to be multiplayer, and has network
	support.

	- Remove bitfields to work around bug in Apple's GCC 4
