Description: Molecular manipulation language
DescDetail: <<
We have developed a new approach to the modelling of nucleic acids 
that is implemented as a computer language called NAB. The method 
was primarily designed to construct models of helical and non-helical 
nucleic acids from a few dozen to a few hundred nucleotides in size, 
and uses a combination of rigid body transformations and distance 
geometry to create candidate structures that match input criteria. 
The language is designed to provide a flexible way to described nucleic 
acid structures at an atomic level of resolution, and contains built-in 
connections to the AMBER and YAMMP molecular modelling packages, 
the generalized Born model for solvation effects, 
and the AVS visualization system.
