Description: Per-line Perl profiler
DescDetail: <<
	The Devel::SmallProf profiler is focused on the time taken for a 
	program run on a line-by-line basis. It is intended to be as 
	"small" in terms of impact on the speed and memory usage of the 
	profiled program as possible and also in terms of being simple 
	to use.
