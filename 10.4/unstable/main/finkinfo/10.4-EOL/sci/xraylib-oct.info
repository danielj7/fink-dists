DescPackaging: <<
This package:
Normally rolls its own xraylib, but that wasn't working; building against an
external xraylib worked just fine.

Common for all octave-forge packages:

We read in postinst and prerm template scripts installed by octaveN and modify
them to use the name of this package because Octave's package manager can't 
cope with non-literal arguments.

The Type: forge (pkgname) is used to minimize what needs to be changed when
using this .info file as a template, or when the package name contains 
underscores.
