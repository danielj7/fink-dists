DescPackaging: <<
 For unknown reasons two rogue perl processes remain after the tests
 have completed successfully. If you are building this package from
 source you will have to kill them off manually.

 Occasionally one of the test servers may be too busy to repond--even
 though the server appears accessible from a web browser--so one of
 the tests might fail: *** not ok 14 www.bacus.pt

 In that case try compiling again later, or remove -t from the
 CompileScript.
 
 Disclaimer:
 I know nothing about perl but somehow I hacked this package together
 to use SSL with webmin.
 Any perl Guru out there interested in maintaining this? =:)

 Same license as OpenSSL.
 %p after -t indicates openssl installation prefix.
