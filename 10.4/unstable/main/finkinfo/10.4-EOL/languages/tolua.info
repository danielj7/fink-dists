# Packages:
#   tolua   Lua/C[++] binding tool
#
# Todo:
#   - tolua author should fix a bug regarding compiling the intermediate file
#     as C++. Use of LUALIB_API gives 'extern' whereas C++ would need
#     'extern "C"'.
#
#     Current output:
#           LUALIB_API int luaopen_XXX (lua_State* tolua_S)
#
#     Should be:
#           #ifdef __cplusplus
#               extern "C"
#           #else
#               LUALIB_API 
#           #endif
#               int luaopen_XXX (lua_State* tolua_S)
#
#           .. or enclosing the whole file in 'extern "C" {' ... '}' block
#
#   - author could make a man page for tolua (currently no such)
#
# Bugs:
#   - ...
#
# Notes:
#   - The "-ev" parameter to scripts is giving quite a lot of (unnecessary?) 
#     build output. Fink policy seems to be to have it; personally I would be
#     okay with just "-e".

Description: Accessing C/C++ code from Lua

Maintainer: Asko Kauppi <akauppi@gmail.com>

DescDetail: <<
tolua is a tool that greatly simplifies the integration of C/C++ code with Lua.
Based on a cleaned header file, tolua automatically generates the binding code
to access C/C++ features from Lua. Using Lua API and metamethod facilities,
tolua maps C/C++ constants, external variables, functions, classes, and
methods to Lua.
<<

DescPackaging: <<
Unlike 'lua51', 'tolua' is not currently packaged so that it would support
having multiple versions installed at one time. This is mainly because tolua
is purely a development tool, and its library is offered as statically linked
.a only. Also, this is how the earlier 5.0-12 tolua package was.
<<

#---
# NOTE: "!/bin/sh -e" is needed for making 'if-then-else-fi' work.
#
# Comments are here to avoid unnecessary output when executing the script (-ev).
#
# No need to 'sed' the 'config' file; we can just append our overload values.
#
# Change in 'src/bin/lua/package.lua' makes produced C binding files compile
# (and especially, link) right even as C++. Relaxes the way for user to "just
# get it right"; otherwise Lua would complain of non-existing 'luaopen_xxx'
# entry in the module.
