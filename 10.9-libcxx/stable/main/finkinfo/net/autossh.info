Description: Restarts SSH sessions and tunnels
DescDetail: <<
  * autossh is a program to start a copy of ssh and monitor it, restarting it
    as necessary should it die or stop passing traffic. The idea is from
    rstunnel (Reliable SSH Tunnel), but implemented in C.
  * The author's view is that it is not as fiddly as rstunnel to get to work.
  * Connection monitoring using a loop of port forwardings or a remote echo
    service.
  * Backs off on rate of connection attempts when experiencing rapid failures
    such as connection refused.
