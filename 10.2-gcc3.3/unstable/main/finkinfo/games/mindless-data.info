Wizards Of The Coast Magic: The Gathering card database.

DescUsage: <<
The first time you run Mindless Automaton, you will be asked to load a magic
card database. Select the one installed by this package which is located under

/sw/share/mindless/oracle.txt

However, you can play different CCGs downlaoding new card references and
modifying your ~/.mindlessrc configuration file.
