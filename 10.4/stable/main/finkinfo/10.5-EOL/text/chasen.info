This package enables to use chasen command using IPADIC without any options.

ChaSen is a tool to analyze a text according to a set of dictionaries that
specifies grammer, part of speech of words, and so on. Because ChaSen itself
has no dictionaries, we need explicit dictionaries to use.  IPADIC is such a
set of dictionaries that specifies Japanese language.
