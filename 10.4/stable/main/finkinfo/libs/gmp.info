Description: GNU multiple precision arithmetic library
DescDetail: <<
 GNU MP is a portable library written in C for arbitrary precision 
 arithmetic on integers, rational numbers, and floating-point numbers.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
 Unfortunately, the libgmpxx4 splitoff, which existed from vers. 4.1.4-1
 through vers. 4.2.1-1008, was misnamed.  It *should* have been called
 libgmpxx3, and the new version of that library should now be in a splitoff
 called libgmpxx4.  To work around this, the splitoff is now called
 libgmpxx (with no number); note that the next time the major version of
 this library changes, the splitoff should go to libgmpxx5.
 Future major versions should be installed to private pkglib dirs so
 that multiple versions may coexist without conflict.

 The source was regenerated from a checkout from upstream that contains
 the cumulative patches relative to 4.3.2, which added support for
 corei family of CPUs.  Re-rolling the dist was much easier than trying to
 create a working patch.
<<
DescPort: <<
 Patch from Ben Hines to build libgmpxx, as of vers. 4.1-2.  As of vers.
 4.1.4-1, libgmpxx gets its own splitoff.

 As of vers. 4.2, mpfr is a separate library, available in fink as the 
 libmpfr1 package.

 The patch, provided by Martin Costabel, makes the 64bit variant compile on
 the new MacBookPros whose core2 duo processor is misidentified as pentium3.

 As of vers. 4.2.3, we are building with -fexceptions, for the benefit of
 ppl library that will be used in gcc 4.4.x.  (Suggested by Jack Howarth;
 see http://www.cs.unipr.it/ppl/ and http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/Graphite .)
