Version: 0.4.2
Revision: 1001

Description: Interface for viewing postfix mail queues
DescDetail: <<
	pfqueue is an effort to give postqueue/mailq/postsuper a
	console (ncurses) interface: it won't add any particular
	functionality to those provided with postfix itself, but
	will hopefully make them easier to use.

	It's a real-time queue scanner, that shows per-queue lists
	of existing messages; the messages can be deleted, put on
	hold or released.

	Just for example, it may be useful to inspect a traffic jam
	at a given time, to see what is falling into and unexpectedly
	crowding your deferred queue.
	
	It can view deferred, active, incoming, and hold queues and
	can delete, hold, release, requeue, and show messages in them.
	
	pfqueue will use the first version of postfix in your $PATH:
	if a Fink postfix package is installed, it will be used,
	otherwise Apple's postfix will be used. Use the '-p' option
	to use a specific instance.
	
	pfqueue also now supports exim in addition to postfix.
