Description: Converts rtf format to several other formats
DocFiles: CHANGES COPYING README TODO
DescDetail: <<
UnRTF is a moderately complicated converter from RTF to other formats,
including HTML, LaTeX, text, and PostScript. Converting to HTML, it
supports tables, fonts, colors, embedded images, hyperlinks, paragraph
alignment among other things. All other conversions are "alpha"--just
begun.
<<
DescPort: <<
Patched Makefile and set '-no-cpp-precomp' in CPPFlags to allow source to
compile. Patched 'malloc.c' to use 'stdlib.h' instead of 'malloc.h'.
