Description: Utility classes for Java 3D
DescDetail: <<
This code is a collection of useful utilities for almost any sort of Java 3D
application. In fact, while this code is Java 3D specific, very little work
needs to be done to use it with any other 3D graphics API, such as OpenGL.
<<
DescPort: <<
The VFX input device is broken because its JNI library is not installed. Also,
the Polhemus and SpaceBall input devices are not installed at all; they are
disabled by default in the upstream package.
