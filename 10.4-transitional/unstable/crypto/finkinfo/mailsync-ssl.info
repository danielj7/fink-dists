Description: Peer to peer synchronization of mailboxes over IMAP
DescPackaging: <<
 This version is compiled with g++-3.3, even in the 10.4 tree.  If it is
 ever updated to a more recent compiler, any packages which depend on
 this one must be updated at the same time.
<<
DescDetail: <<
 Mailsync is a way of synchronizing a collection of mailboxes.  The
 algorithm is a 3-way diff.  Two mailboxes are simultaneously compared
 to a record of the state of both mailboxes at last sync.  New messages
 and message deletions are propagated between the two mailboxes.  If
 you're familiar with CVS, it's the same principle, except there's no
 opportunity for conflicts.
