Package: zenmap
Version: 5.35
Revision: 2
Maintainer: Daniel Johnson <daniel@daniel-johnson.org>
Type: python (2.6)
Description: Offical Nmap GUI
DescDetail: <<
	Zenmap is the official Nmap Security Scanner GUI. It is a
	multi-platform (Linux, Windows, Mac OS X, BSD, etc.) free and open
	source application which aims to make Nmap easy for beginners to use
	while providing advanced features for experienced Nmap users.
	Frequently used scans can be saved as profiles to make them easy to run
	repeatedly. A command creator allows interactive creation of Nmap
	command lines. Scan results can be saved and viewed later. Saved scan
	results can be compared with one another to see how they differ. The
	results of recent scans are stored in a searchable database.
<<
DescUsage: <<
	On Intel Macs, installing psyco-py%type_pkg[python] will speed up the
	zenmap front end.
	
	zenmap should be run as root or with sudo for full functionallity.
	With some versions of glib2, zenmap crashes with an error about being
	unable to recognize the image type of some files. Running 'sudo -s' first,
	then running zenmap should fix this.
