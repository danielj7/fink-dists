Description: Interpreted language and scientific graphics                       
DescDetail: <<
  Yorick is an interpreted programming language for:                  

  * scientific simulations or calculations                                      
  * postprocessing or steering large simulation codes                           
  * interactive scientific graphics                                             
  * reading, writing, and translating large files of numbers                    
                                                                                
  The language features a compact syntax for many common array                  
  operations, so it processes large arrays of numbers very quickly and          
  efficiently.  Superficially, yorick code resembles C code, but yorick         
  variables are never explicitly declared and have a dynamic scoping            
  similar to many Lisp dialects.  The yorick language is designed to be         
  typed interactively at a keyboard, as well as stored in files for             
  later use.                                                                    
                                                                                
  This package includes an emacs-based development environment, which           
  you can launch by typing M-x yorick in emacs.  (See                           
  %p/share/yorick/1.5/yorick.el for details.) 
<<
DescUsage: <<
  "yorick -batch testfull.i" runs test suite.                          
  Start yorick and type Y_SITE to print the site directory.                     
  Documentation is in Y_SITE/doc/.  Before you can run the emacs                
  development environment, you need to load Y_SITE/yorick.el into emacs         
  in your ~/.emacs or the site-lisp.  Read yorick.el for details.
