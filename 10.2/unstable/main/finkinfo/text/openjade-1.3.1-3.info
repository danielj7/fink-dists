Description: Implementation of DSSSL
DescDetail: <<
Jade is James Clark's implementation of DSSSL -- Document Style Semantics and
Specification Language -- an ISO standard for formatting SGML (and XML)
documents.

OpenJade is a project undertaken by the DSSSL community to maintain and extend
Jade, as well as the related SP suite of SGML/XML processing tools. OpenJade
and OpenSP are distributed under the same license as Jade.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
* conflicts with opensp, since it contains its own (older) copy of opensp
<<
DescPort: <<
* force usage of pthreads (openjade has some strange thoughts about Mach based
  systems which makes this necessary)
* work around template instantiation problem (thanks, Matthias)
* some other minor problems fixed
* hacks for gcc3 and more
* Maybe we should make OpenSP a splitoff, so users may have the newest version.
