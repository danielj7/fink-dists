DescDetail: <<
From http://lartmaker.nl/rsync/:

Many files on HFS+, the Mac's most common file system, have metadata. This
is partly a leftover from the past (resource forks), and partly a new
development (ACLs, extended attributes). Plain rsync doesn't (yet) cope
with this metadata.

Since OS X 10.4 (aka Tiger) the MacOS ships with a modified version of
rsync. [sic] An added option, -E, enables the transfer of extended
attributes. This is done by encapsulating the resource fork, Finder data
et al in a synthetic file which is added to the rsync transfer list. The
name of this file is formed by prepending ._ to the name of the original
file, a technique which is also used when copying data from HFS+
partitions to non-Apple file systems such as NFS mounts. It may not be
pretty or foolproof (what happens when both foo and ._foo exist?), but at
least it's documented by Apple and not likely to change in the very near
future. This rsync derivative is based on rsync-2.6.3.
