Description: C library for parsing XML
DescDetail: <<
 This is expat, a C library for parsing XML, written by James Clark.
 Expat is a stream-oriented XML parser. This means that you register
 handlers with the parser before starting the parse. These handlers
 are called when the parser discovers the associated structures in the
 document being parsed. A start tag is an example of the kind of
 structures for which you may register handlers.

DescPort: <<
 Makefile.in edited to add appropriate --mandir and DESTDIR hooks
 I have tried using the check tool to verify that the library works
 Unfortunately due to errors (possibly in bash), the following output results

 tests/runtests: error: ~/desktop/downloads/expat-1.95.4/tests
 /.../expat-1.95.4/tests/.libs/runtests does not exist
 This script is just a wrapper for runtests.
 See the libtool documentation for more information.

 However, running 
 bash-2.05b$ ./tests/runtests
 results in the following output:

 Running suite(s): basic
 100%: Checks: 21, Failures: 0, Errors: 0
