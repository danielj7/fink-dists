Description: Perl module for generating recursive-descent parsers
DescDetail: <<
Parse::RecDescent incrementally generates top-down recursive-descent text
parsers from simple yacc-like grammar specifications. It provides:  
 - Regular expressions or literal strings as terminals (tokens),  
 - Multiple (non-contiguous) productions for any rule,  
 - Repeated and optional subrules within productions,  
 - Full access to Perl within actions specified as part of the grammar,  
 - Simple automated error reporting during parser generation and parsing,  
 - The ability to commit to, uncommit to, or reject particular productions
   during a parse,  
 - The ability to pass data up and down the parse tree ("down" via subrule
   argument lists, "up" via subrule return values)  
 - Incremental extension of the parsing grammar (even during a parse),  
 - Precompilation of parser objects,  
 - User-definable reduce-reduce conflict resolution via "scoring" of matching
   productions.
