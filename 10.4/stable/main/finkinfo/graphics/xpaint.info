Package: xpaint
Version: 2.9.9.1
Revision: 1
Description: Image editor/painting program
DescDetail: <<
XPaint is an X Window System color image editing program which supports
most standard paint program options.  XPaint also supports advanced
features like image processing algorithms and layers. XPaint allows you
to edit multiple images simultaneously and supports a variety of image
formats, including PPM, XBM, TIFF, JPEG, etc.

Install the xpaint package if you need a paint program for X which is
relatively easy to use - and use "The Gimp" for more professional work.

DescPort: <<
Program mis-determines prototypes for randomizer functions (misc.h).
Since there is an #include for the header that contains the (system)
prototypes, just rely on that and remove the program's bad idea.

Unify autoconf from rw/ subdir into main and convert to using
pkg-config for many dependencies rather than making
non-platform-portable guesses about locations and flag-orderings.

Add missing test for sys_errlist (already apparently expected in
relevant .c but not implemented in configure?)

Apparently was relying on imake or other nonsense to create a symlink
to some X11/ subdir based on configuration choice of widgetset? That
breaks dependency tracking and wasn't even working at all.

"bool" is a system-defined type (stdbool.h) so it cannot be a formal
variablename for setWriteTextSensitive.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
Scrap utils/ programs because they have not previously been supplied
and it's not clear that they have a specific purpose or fill an
unfilled niche. They would need to be fixed for automake anyway.

Neither current upstream autotools build system nor previous versions'
imake system supplied an installed librw (and xpaint had linked
directly to the static lib), so our conversion to recursive autotools
will consider it a convenience lib rather than a public library.
