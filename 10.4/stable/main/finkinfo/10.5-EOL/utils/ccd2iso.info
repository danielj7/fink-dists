#PatchScript: perl -pi -e "s,-g -O,-O,g;s,-O2,-Os,g" configure*
#the patchscript had no effect because it touched 'configure.in',
#which caused autotools to regenerate 'configure' from it (overwriting
#changes to 'configure'), but the flags themselves come from autotools
#not from 'configure.in' (patchscript to that file did not actually
#change it!) so the generated configure still wound up having the
#as-generated (!= patched) flags. Would need to patch *only*
#'configure' (which would require rev-up because changes binary
#result), so just disabling it (avoiding touching 'configure.in'
#prevents regeneration). --dmacks
ConfigureParams: --disable-dependency-tracking
