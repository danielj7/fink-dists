Description: Perfect hash function generator
DescDetail: <<
This is GNU gperf. It is a program that generates perfect
hash functions for sets of key words. A perfect hash function is:

A hash function and a data structure that allows
recognition of a key word in a set of words using
exactly 1 probe into the data structure.

The doc/gperf.html file explains how the program works,
the form of the input, what options are available, and hints on
choosing the best options for particular key words set.

DescPort: <<
Needed by all the EDA stuff I have my eye on (such as
gEDA).
<<
DescPackaging: <<
Test suite is not parallelized because tests clobber each other's
object files and output files... lame.
