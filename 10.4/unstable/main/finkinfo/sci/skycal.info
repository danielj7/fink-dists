Description: Astronomer's almanac tools
DescDetail: <<
Since V1 in 1993, this command line utility has provided simple but
enormously useful data for astronomers.  It's interface is odd, but
the calculations it provides are just what you need.

   departments which install this as a utility notify the author

DescPort: <<
To fix a conflict with round() in /usr/include/architecture/ppc/math.h,
I renamed the local function to sc_round.
