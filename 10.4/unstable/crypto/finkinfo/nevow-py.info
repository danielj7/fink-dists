Description: Web application construction kit
DescDetail: <<
Nevow is a web application construction kit written in Python. It is
designed to allow the programmer to express as much of the view logic
as desired in Python, and includes a pure Python XML expression syntax
named stan to facilitate this.  However it also provides rich support
for designer-edited templates, using a very small XML attribute language
to provide bi-directional template manipulation capability.
