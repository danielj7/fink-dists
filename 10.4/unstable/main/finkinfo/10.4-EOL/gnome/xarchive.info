Description: Frontend for various command line archivers
DescDetail: <<
	XArchive is a GTK+2 graphical frontend that uses external wrappers
	to communicate with the command line archiving tools. This makes
	adding support for a new archive format a simple matter of writing
	a wrapper for that format's command line tool and putting it into
	XArchive's wrapper directory.

	Depending on the capabilities of the command line tool, XArchive can 
	handle creation, extraction and manipulation of archives.

	Currently there are bash shell wrappers for:
	tar, rar, zip, 7zip, arj, deb, rpm and ace.
	(ace support using program unace, so extraction only.
	deb and rpm support is also extraction only. To keep things
	sane the appropriate packaging tools should be used to
	modify deb's and rpm's.)
