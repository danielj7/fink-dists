Description: Crystal modules for OpenDX
DescDetail: <<
The XTM modules for OpenDX allow you to read molecular structure files, 
electron density maps, electrostatic potentials, CCD images and other 
types of molecular structure data into DX. In addition to the powerful 
scientific visualization constructs available in OpenDX, 
you can generate molecular surfaces, peptide ribbons and other common 
molecular graphics constructs. OpenDX is also an excellent environment 
for scientific computation. Full x-ray diffraction data processing 
and molecular simulation features will be available soon. 
The best way to learn is by reading and running the annotated sample nets 
included with this package in the directory /sw/share/xtm/macros
