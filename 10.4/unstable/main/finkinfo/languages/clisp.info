DescDetail: <<
A feature loaded common lisp programming environment with unicode
support, excellent ANSI compliance, and a full-featured MOP.
<<

DescPort: <<
There is a problem with the build script that causes make to fail.  Removing
src/config.cache and run make agains correct the problem.
FFI is not working.
<<

DescPackaging: <<
Fink's maxima package uses clisp as it's host lisp. As part of maxima's build
process, it dumps a new lisp image. This image will only work reliably if it
is used with a clisp kernel of the same version built under the same
conditions. In other words, the version of clisp used to run maxima must be
exactly the same as the version used to build maxima. Any time you commit an
update to this package that changes clisp's version or revision, you must also
change the versioned dependency in fink's maxima package (and of course also
bump maxima's revision).
