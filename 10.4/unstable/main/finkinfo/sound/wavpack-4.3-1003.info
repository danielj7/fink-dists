DescDetail: <<
WavPack is a completely open audio compression format providing lossless,
high-quality lossy, and a unique hybrid compression mode. Although the
technology is loosely based on previous versions of WavPack, the new version 4
format has been designed from the ground up to offer unparalleled performance
and functionality.

In the default lossless mode WavPack acts just like a WinZip compressor for
audio files. However, unlike MP3 or WMA encoding which can affect the sound
quality, not a single bit of the original information is lost, so there's no
chance of degradation. This makes lossless mode ideal for archiving audio
material or any other situation where quality is paramount. The compression
ratio depends on the source material, but generally is between 30% and 70%.

The hybrid mode provides all the advantages of lossless compression with an
additional bonus. Instead of creating a single file, this mode creates both a
relatively small, high-quality lossy file that can be used all by itself, and a
"correction" file that (when combined with the lossy file) provides full
lossless restoration. For some users this means never having to choose between
lossless and lossy compression!

WavPack 4.3 features include:
  * Compatible with virtually all PCM audio formats including 8, 16, and 24-bit
    ints; 32-bit floats; mono, stereo, and multichannel; sampling rates from 6
    to 192 kHz (and non-standard rates)
  * Multiplatform support including Windows, Linux, and OS X
  * Instantly seekable and streaming capable
  * Error-tolerant block format conducive to hardware decoding
  * Optional "asymmetrical" mode for improved compression
  * MD5 audio checksums for verification and identification
  * Unique hybrid mode (provides high quality lossy + "correction" file
  * Hybrid mode now operates as low as 2.25 bits/sample (or 196 kbps for CD
    audio)
  * Free and open source with easy to use library interface and unrestrictive
    license (BSD)
  * Intuitive command line interface (with wildcards and destination directory)
  * Small, efficient executable (no large programs or dlls to install)
  * Fully backward compatible to WavPack 1.0
  * Self-extracting archives (Windows only)
  * Complete piping support
