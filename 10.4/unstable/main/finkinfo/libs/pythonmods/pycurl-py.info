Package: pycurl-py%type_pkg[python]
Version: 7.15.5.1
Revision: 2
Type: python (2.3 2.4 2.5)
Description: Python bindings for libcurl
DescPackaging: <<
 setup.py installs all docs--so no need for DocFiles--but
 in a non-versioned directory, so we need to rename
 %i/share/doc/pycurl to %i/share/doc/pycurl-py%type_pkg[python].
 
 We conflict with openssl*-dev so that we don't accidentally
 link to the wrong libs. Not sure if it would really be a
 problem, but just in case...
 
 Added patch to pycurl.c to allow building with libcurl4.
