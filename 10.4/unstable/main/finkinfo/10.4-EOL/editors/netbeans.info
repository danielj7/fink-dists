Description: Platform/IDE for developing Java applications
DescDetail: <<
NetBeans refers to both a platform for the development of Java desktop
applications, and an integrated development environment (IDE) developed using
the NetBeans Platform.

The NetBeans Platform allows applications to be developed from a set of modular
software components called modules. A module is a Java archive file that
contains Java classes written to interact with the NetBeans Open APIs and a
manifest file that identifies it as a module. Applications built on modules can
be extended by adding new modules. Since modules can be developed
independently, applications based on the NetBeans platform can be extended by
third party developers.
<<
DescUsage: <<
Because NetBeans is distributed with an OS X installer, the existence of a Fink
port might seem odd. However, it is necessary for certain applications, such as
JSwat, that depend on NetBeans and need to know where it is installed.

Type "netbeans" at the command line to launch it.
