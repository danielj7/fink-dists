Description: Perl module for biology
DescDetail: <<
Bioperl is a collection of perl modules that facilitate the development of perl 
scripts for bioinformatics applications. As such, it does not include ready to use 
programs in the sense that many commercial packages and free web-based interfaces 
(eg Entrez, SRS) do. On the other hand, bioperl does provide reusable perl modules 
that facilitate writing perl scripts for sequence manipulation, accessing of 
databases using a range of data formats and execution and parsing of the results of 
various molecular biology programs including Blast, clustalw, TCoffee, genscan, 
ESTscan and HMMER. Consequently, bioperl enables developing scripts that can analyze 
large quantities of sequence data in ways that are typically difficult or impossible 
with web based systems.
