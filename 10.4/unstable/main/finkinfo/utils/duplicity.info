DescDetail: <<
Duplicity backs directories by producing encrypted
tar-format volumes and uploading them to a remote 
or local file server. Because duplicity uses 
librsync, the incremental archives are space 
efficient and only record the parts of files that 
have changed since the last backup. Because 
duplicity uses GnuPG to encrypt and/or sign these
archives, they will be safe from spying and/or 
modification by the server.

The duplicity package also includes the rdiffdir
utility. Rdiffdir is an extension of librsync's 
rdiff to directories---it can be used to produce 
signatures and deltas of directories as well as 
regular files. These signatures and deltas are in
GNU tar format.
