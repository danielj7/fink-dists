Description: Remotely administer Unix file systems 
DescDetail: <<
A suite of Unix command-line tools and a server designed to
remotely administer the file systems of multiple Unix machines.

At its core, radmind operates as a tripwire. It is able to detect
changes to any managed filesystem object, e.g. files, directories,
links, etc. However, radmind goes further than just integrity
checking: once a change is detected, radmind can optionally
reverse the change.

Each managed machine may have its own loadset composed of multiple,
layered overloads. This allows, for example, the operating system
to be described separately from applications.

Loadsets are stored on a remote server. By updating a loadset on
the server, changes can be pushed to managed machines.
